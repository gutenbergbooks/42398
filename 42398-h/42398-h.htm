<span class="larger">THE LOST CHILDREN</span></h2>

<p>The valleys of Pennsylvania were dotted with log
cabins in the days of the French and Indian wars.
Sometimes a number of the little houses stood close
together for protection, but often they were built far
apart. Wherever the pioneer saw good farm land
he settled. It was a new sensation for men to be
able to go into the country and take whatever land
attracted them. Gentle rolling fields, with wide
views of distant country through the notches of the
hills, shining rivers, splendid uncut forests, and rich
pasturage were to be found not far from the growing
village of Philadelphia, and were free to any who
wished to take them. Such a land would have been
a paradise, but for one shadow that hung over it.
In the background always lurked the Indians, who
might at any time, without rhyme or reason, steal
down upon the lonely hamlet or cabin, and lay it
waste. The pioneer looked across the broad acres
of central Pennsylvania and found them beautiful.
Only when he had built his home and planted his
fields did he fully realize the constant peril that
lurked in the wooded mountains.</p>

<p>English, French, and Spanish came to the new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
world, and the English proved themselves the best
colonists. They settled the central part of the Atlantic
Coast, but among them and mixed with them
were people of other lands. The Dutch took a liking
for the Island of Manhattan and the Hudson River,
the Swedes for Delaware, and into the colony of
William Penn came pilgrims from what was called
the Palatinate, Germans, a strong race drawn partly
by desire for religious freedom, partly by the reports
of the great free lands across the ocean. They
brought with them the tongue, the customs, and the
names of the German Fatherland, and many a valley
of eastern Pennsylvania heard only the German language
spoken.</p>

<p>The Indian tribes known as the Six Nations
roamed through the country watered by the Susquehanna.
They hunted through all the land south of
the Great Lakes. Sometimes they fought with the
Delawares, sometimes with the Catawbas, and again
they would smoke the calumet or pipe of peace with
their neighbors, and give up the war-path for months
at a time. But the settlers could never be sure of
their intentions. Wily French agents might sow
seeds of discord in the Indians' minds, and then the
chiefs who had lately exchanged gifts with the settlers
might suddenly steal upon some quiet village
and leave the place in ruins. This constant peril
was the price men had to pay in return for the right
to take whatever land they liked.</p>

<p>In a little valley of eastern Pennsylvania a German<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
settler named John Hartman had built a cabin
in 1754. He had come to this place with his wife
and four children because here he might earn a good
living from the land. He was a hard worker, and
his farm was prospering. He had horses and cattle,
and his wife spun and wove the clothing for the
family. The four children, George, Barbara, Regina,
and Christian, looked upon the valley as their home,
forgetting the German village over the sea. Not far
away lived neighbors, and sometimes the children
went to play with other boys and girls, and sometimes
their friends spent a holiday on John Hartman's
farm.</p>

<p>The family, like all farmers' families, rose early.
Before they began the day's work the father would
read to them from his big Bible, which he had
brought from his native land as his most valuable
possession. On a bright morning in the autumn of
1754 he gathered his family in the living-room of his
cabin and read them a Bible lesson. The doors and
windows stood open, and the sun flooded the little
house, built of rough boards, and scrupulously clean.
The farmer's dog, Wasser, lay curled up asleep
just outside the front door, and a pair of horses, already
harnessed, stood waiting to be driven to the
field. Birds singing in the trees called to the children
to hurry out-of-doors. They tried to listen to
their father's voice as he read, and to pay attention.
As they all knelt he prayed for their safety.
Then they had breakfast, and the father and mother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
made plans for the day. Mrs. Hartman was to
take the younger boy, Christian, to the flour-mill
several miles away, and if they had time was to call
at the cabin of a sick friend. The father and George
went to the field to finish their sowing before the
autumn rains should come, and the two little girls
were told to look after the house till their mother
should return. Little Christian sat upon an old
horse, held on by his mother, and waved his hand
to his father and George as he rode by the field on
his way to the mill.</p>

<p>The girls, like their mother, were good housekeepers.
They set the table for dinner, and at noon
Barbara blew the big tin horn to call her father and
brother. As they were eating dinner the dog
Wasser came running into the house growling, and
acting as if he were very much frightened. Mr.
Hartman spoke to him, and called him to his side.
But the dog stood in the doorway, and then suddenly
leaped forward and sprang upon an Indian who came
around the wall.</p>

<p>The peril that lurked in the woods had come.
John Hartman jumped to the door, but two rifle
bullets struck him down. George sprang up, only
to fall beside his father. An Indian killed the dog
with his tomahawk. Into the peaceful cabin
swarmed fifteen yelling savages. Barbara ran up a
ladder into the loft, and Regina fell on her knees,
murmuring "Herr Jesus! Herr Jesus!" The Indians
hesitated, then one of them seized her, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
made a motion with his knife across her lips to bid
her be silent. Another went after Barbara and
brought her down from the loft, and then the Indians
ordered the two girls to put on the table all the food
there was in the cabin.</p>

<p>When the food was gone the savages plundered
the house, making bundles of what they wanted and
slinging them over their shoulders. They took the
two little girls into the field. There another girl
stood tied to the fence. When she saw Barbara and
Regina she began to cry, and called in German for
her mother. While the three frightened girls stood
close together the Indians set fire to the cabin.
Very soon the log house that had cost John Hartman
so much labor was burned to the ground.
When their work of destruction was completed the
Indians took the three children into the woods.</p>

<p>At sunset Mrs. Hartman returned from the flour-mill
with little Christian riding his horse, but when
she came up the road it seemed as if her house had
disappeared. Yet the pine trees, the fences, the
plowed fields, and the orchard were still there. The
little boy cried, "Where is our house, mother?" and
the poor woman could not understand.</p>

<p>The story of what had occurred was only too
plain to her a few minutes later. What had happened
to many other pioneers had happened to her
family. Clutching Christian in her arms she ran to
the house of her nearest neighbor. There she heard
that the Indians had left the same track of blood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
through other parts of the valley; that farmers had
been slain; their crops burned; and their children
carried off into the wilderness. The terrified settlers
banded together for protection. For weeks new
stories came of the Indians' massacres. If ever
there were heartless savages these were! They did
not carry all the children to their wigwams; some
were killed on the way; and among them was little
Barbara Hartman. Word came from time to time
of some of the stolen children, but there was no
word of Regina or Susan Smith, the daughter of the
neighboring farmer.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Far in the forests of western New York was the
camp of a great Indian tribe. The wigwams stood
on the banks of a beautiful mountain stream, broken
by great rocks that sent the water leaping in cascades
and falls. In one of the wigwams lived the
mother of a famous warrior of the tribe, and with her
were two girls whom she treated as her daughters.
The name of the old squaw was She-lack-la, which
meant "the Dark and Rainy Cloud," a name given
her because at times she grew very angry and ill-treated
every one around her. Fortunately there
were two girls in her wigwam, and when the old
squaw was in a bad temper they had each other for
protection. The older girl had been given the name
of Saw-que-han-na, or "the White Lily," and the
other was known as Kno-los-ka, "the Short-legged
Bear." Like all the Indian girls they had to work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
hard, grinding corn, cooking and keeping house for
the boys and men who were brought up to hunt and
fight. Sawquehanna was tall and strong, spoke the
language of the tribe, and looked very much like her
Indian girl friends.</p>

<p>In the meantime many battles had been fought
through the country of the pioneers, and the English
colonists were beating the French and Indians, and
driving the Frenchmen farther and farther north.
In 1765 the long war between the two nations
ended. Under a treaty of peace the English Colonel
Boquet demanded that all the white children who
had been captured by the Indian tribes should be
surrendered to the English officers. So one day
white soldiers came into the woods of western New
York and found the wigwams there. The children
were called out, and the soldiers took the two girls
from the old squaw Shelackla. Then they went on
to the other tribes, and from each they took all the
white children. They carried them to Fort Duquesne.
The Fort was in western Pennsylvania, and as soon
as it was known that the lost white children were
there, fathers and mothers all over the country hurried
to find their boys and girls. Many of the children
had been away so long that they hardly remembered
their parents, but most of the parents knew
their children, and found them again within the
walls of the fortress.</p>

<p>Some of the children, however, were not claimed.
Sawquehanna and her friend Knoloska and nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
fifty more found no one looking for them and
wondered what would happen to them. After they
had waited at Fort Duquesne eight days, Colonel
Boquet started to march with his band of children to
the town of Carlisle, in hopes that they might find
friends farther east, or at least kind-hearted people
who would give the children homes. He sent news
of their march all through the country, and from day
to day as they traveled through the mountains by
way of Fort Ligonier, Raystown, and Louden, eager
people arrived to search among the band of children
for lost sons and daughters. When the children
came to Carlisle the town was filled with settlers
from the East.</p>

<p>The children stood in the market-place, and the
men and women pressed about them, trying to
recognize little ones who had been carried away by
Indians years before. Some people who lived in
the Blue Mountains were in the throng, and they
recognized the dark-haired Indian girl Knoloska as
Susan, the daughter of Mr. Smith, the farmer who had
lived near the Hartmans. Knoloska and Sawquehanna
had not been separated for a long time.
They had kept together ever since the white soldiers
had freed them from the old squaw's wigwam.
Sawquehanna could not bear to think of having her
comrade leave her, and Susan clung to her adopted
sister's arm and kissed her again and again. The
white people were much kinder than the old squaw
had been, and instead of beating the girls when they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
cried, and frightening them with threats, the officers
told Sawquehanna that she would probably find
some friends soon, and if she did not, that perhaps
Susan's family would let her live in their home.
But as nobody seemed to recognize her Sawquehanna
felt more lonely than she had ever felt before.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Mrs. Hartman was living in the valley
with her son Christian, who had grown to be a
strong boy of fourteen. Neighbors told her that
the lost children were being brought across the
mountains to Carlisle, but there seemed little chance
that her own Regina might be one of them. She
decided, however, that she must go to the town and
see. Travel was difficult in those days, but the
brave woman set out over the mountains and across
the rivers to Carlisle, and at last reached the town
market-place. She looked anxiously among the
girls, remembering her little daughter as she had
been on that autumn day eleven years before; but
none of the girls had the blue eyes, light yellow
hair and red cheeks of Regina. Mrs. Hartman
shook her head, and decided that her daughter was
not among these children.</p>

<p>As she turned away, disconsolate, Colonel Boquet
said to her, "Can't you find your daughter?"</p>

<p>"No," said the disappointed mother, "my daughter
is not among those children."</p>

<p>"Are you sure?" asked the colonel. "Are there
no marks by which you might know her?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
"None, sir," she answered, shaking her head.</p>

<p>Colonel Boquet considered the matter for a few
minutes. "Did you ever sing to her?" he asked
presently. "Was there no old hymn that she was
fond of?"</p>

<p>The mother looked up quickly. "Yes, there
was!" she answered. "I have often sung her to
sleep in my arms with an old German hymn we all
loved so well."</p>

<p>"Then," said the colonel, "you and I will walk
along the line of girls and you shall sing that hymn.
It may be that your daughter has changed so much
that you wouldn't know her, but she may remember
the tune."</p>

<p>Mrs. Hartman looked very doubtful. "There is
little use in it, sir," she said, "for certainly I should
have known her if she were here; and if I try your
plan all these soldiers will laugh at me for a foolish
old German woman."</p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Sawquehanna Seemed to Remember the Voice</span>
</div></div>

<p>The colonel, however, begged her at least to try
his plan, and she finally consented. They walked
back to the place where the children were standing,
and Mrs. Hartman began to sing in a trembling
voice the first words of the old hymn:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="line">"Alone, and yet not all alone, am I</div>
<div class="indent2">In this lone wilderness."</div>
</div></div>

<p>As she went on singing every one stopped talking
and turned to look at her. The woman's hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
were clasped as if in prayer, and her eyes were
closed. The sun shone full upon her white hair and
upturned face. There was something very beautiful
in the picture she made, and there was silence in the
market-place as her gentle voice went on through
the words of the hymn.</p>

<p>The mother had begun the second verse when
one of the children gave a cry. It was Sawquehanna,
who seemed suddenly to have remembered
the voice and words. She rushed forward, and
flung her arms about the mother's neck, crying,
"Mother, mother!" Then, with her arms tight
about her, the tall girl joined in singing the words
that had lulled her to sleep in their cabin home.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="line">"Alone, and yet not all alone, am I</div>
<div class="indent2">In this lone wilderness,</div>
<div class="line">I feel my Saviour always nigh;</div>
<div class="indent2">He comes the weary hours to bless.</div>
<div class="line">I am with Him, and He with me,</div>
<div class="indent2">E'en here alone I cannot be."</div>
</div></div>

<p>The people in the market-place moved on about
their own affairs, and the mother and daughter were
left together. Now Mrs. Hartman recognized the
blue eyes of Regina, and knew her daughter in
spite of her height and dark skin. Regina began
to remember the days of her childhood, and the
years she had spent among the Indians were forgotten.
She was a white girl again, and happier now
than she had ever thought to be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
Next day Knoloska, now Susan Smith, and Sawquehanna,
or Regina Hartman, went back to their
homes in the valley. Many a settler there had
found his son or daughter in the crowd of lost
children at Carlisle.</p>

<br />
<span class="larger">THE GREAT JOURNEY OF LEWIS AND CLARK</span></h2>

<p>French is still spoken in Quebec and New Orleans,
reminders that the land of the lilies had much
to do with the settlement of North America. Many
of the greatest explorers of the continent were Frenchmen.
Jacques Cartier sailed up the St. Lawrence
River in 1534, and Champlain in 1603 founded New
France, and from his small fortress at Quebec
planned an empire that should reach to Florida. In
1666 Robert Cavalier, the Sieur de La Salle, came to
Canada, and set out from his <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">seigneurie</i> near the
rapids of Montreal to find the long-sought road to
China. Instead of doing that he discovered the
Ohio River, first of white men he voyaged across the
Great Lakes and sailed down the Mississippi to its
mouth. Great explorer, he mapped the country
from the St. Lawrence to the Gulf of Mexico, from
the Mississippi to the Atlantic Ocean, and built frontier-posts
in the wilderness. He traveled thousands
of miles, and in 1682 he raised the lilies of France
near the mouth of the Mississippi and named the
whole territory he had covered <i>Louisiana</i>, in honor
of King Louis XIV of France.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
The first colony on the Gulf was established seventeen
years later at Biloxi by a Canadian <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">seigneur</i>
named Iberville. Soon afterward this <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">seigneur's</i>
brother, Bienville, founded New Orleans and attracted
many French pioneers there. The French proved to
be better explorers than farmers or settlers. In the
south they hunted the sources of the Arkansas and
Red Rivers, and discovered the little-known Pawnee
and Comanche Indians. In the north they pressed
westward and came in sight of the Rocky Mountains.
At that time it seemed as if France was to own at
least two-thirds of the continent. The English general,
Braddock, was defeated at Fort Duquesne in
1755, and the French commanded the Ohio as well
as the Mississippi; but four years later the English
general, Wolfe, won the victory of the Plains of
Abraham near Quebec; and France's chance was
over. Men in Paris who knew little concerning the
new world did not scruple to give away their country's
title to vast lands. The French ceded Canada
and all of La Salle's old province of Louisiana east
of the Mississippi, except New Orleans, to England.
Soon afterward France, to outwit England, gave
Spain New Orleans and her claim to the half of the
Mississippi Valley west of the river to which the
name Louisiana now came to be restricted.</p>

<p>The French, however, were great adventurers by
nature, and Napoleon, changing the map of Europe,
could not keep his fingers from North America. He
planned to win back the New France that had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
given away. Spain was weak, and Napoleon traded
a small province in Italy for the great tract of Louisiana.
He meant to colonize and fortify this splendid
empire, but before it could be done enemies gathered
against his eagles at home, and to save his European
throne he had to forsake his western colony.</p>

<p>When Thomas Jefferson became President in 1801,
he found the people of the South and West disturbed
at France's repossessing herself of so much territory.
He sent Robert R. Livingston and James Monroe to
Paris to try to buy New Orleans and the country
known as the Floridas for $2,000,000. Instead Napoleon
offered to sell not only New Orleans, but the
whole of Louisiana Territory extending as far west
as the Rocky Mountains for $15,000,000. Napoleon
insisted on the sale, and the envoys agreed. Jefferson
and the people in the eastern United States were
dismayed at the price paid for what they considered
almost worthless land, but the West was delighted,
owning the mouth of the great Mississippi and with
the country beyond it free to them to explore. In
time this purchase of Louisiana, or the territory
stretching to the Rocky Mountains, forming the
larger part of what are now thirteen of the states of
the Union, was to be considered one of the greatest
pieces of good fortune in the country's history.</p>

<p>Scarcely anything was known of Louisiana, except
the stories told by a few hunters. Jefferson decided
that the region must be explored, and asked his
young secretary, Meriwether Lewis, who had shown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
great interest in the new country, to make a path
through the wilderness. Lewis chose his friend
William Clark to accompany him, and picked thirty-two
experienced men for their party. May 14, 1804,
the expedition set out in a barge with sails and two
smaller boats from a point on the Missouri River
near St. Louis.</p>

<p>The nearer part of this country had already been
well explored by hunters and trappers, and especially
by that race of adventurous Frenchmen who were
rovers by nature. These men could not endure the
confining life of towns, and were continually pushing
into the wilderness, driving their light canoes over
the waters of the great rivers, and often sharing the
tents of friendly Indians they met. Many had become
almost more Indian than white man,&mdash;had married
Indian wives and lived the wandering life of the native.
Such a man Captain Lewis found at the start
of his journey, and took with him to act as interpreter
among the Sioux and tribes who spoke a similar
language.</p>

<p>The party traveled rapidly at the outset of their
journey, meeting small bands of Indians, and passing
one or two widely-separated frontier settlements.
They had to pass many difficult rapids in the river,
but as they were for the most part expert boatmen
they met with no mishaps. The last white town on
the Missouri was a little hamlet called La Charrette,
consisting of seven houses, with as many families
located there to hunt and trade for skins and furs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
As they went up the river they frequently met canoes
loaded with furs coming down. Day by day they took
careful observations, and made maps of the country
through which they were traveling, and when they
met Indians tried to learn the history and customs of
the tribe. Captain Lewis wrote down many of their
curious traditions. The Osage tribe had given their
name to a river that flowed into the Missouri a little
more than a hundred miles from its mouth. There
were three tribes of this nation: the Great Osages,
numbering about five hundred warriors; the Little
Osages, who lived some six miles distant from the
others, and numbered half as many men; and the
Arkansas band, six hundred strong, who had left the
others some time before, and settled on the Vermillion
River. The Osages lived in villages and were
good farmers, usually peaceful, although naturally
strong and tireless. Captain Lewis found a curious
tradition as to the origin of their tribe. The story
was that the founder of the nation was a snail, who
lived quietly on the banks of the Osage until a high
flood swept him down to the Missouri, and left him
exposed on the shore. The heat of the sun at length
ripened him into a man, but with the change in his nature
he did not forget his native haunts on the Osage,
but immediately bent his way in that direction. He
was, however, soon overtaken by hunger and fatigue,
when happily the Great Spirit appeared, and giving
him a bow and arrow showed him how to kill and
cook deer, and cover himself with the skins. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
then pushed on to his home, but as he neared it
he was met by a beaver, who inquired haughtily who
he was, and by what authority he came to disturb
his possession. The Osage answered that the river
was his own, for he had once lived on its borders.
As they stood disputing, the daughter of the beaver
came, and having by her entreaties made peace between
her father and the young stranger, it was proposed
that the Osage should marry the young
beaver, and share the banks of the river with her
family. The Osage readily consented, and from this
happy marriage there came the village and the nation
of the Wasbasha, or Osages, who kept a reverence
for their ancestors, never hunting the beaver,
because in killing that animal they would kill a
brother of the Osage. The explorers found, however,
that since the value of beaver skins had risen
in trade with the white men, these Indians were
not so particular in their reverence for their relatives.</p>

<p>The mouth of the Platte River was reached on
July 21st, and the next day Lewis held a council
with the Ottoes and Missouri Indians, and named the
site Council Bluffs. At each of these meetings between
Lewis and the Indians the white man would
explain that this territory was now part of the United
States, would urge the tribes to trade with their new
neighbors, and then present them with gifts of
medals, necklaces, rings, tobacco, ornaments of all
sorts, and often powder and arms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
The Indians were friendly and each day taught
the white men something new. Both Captain Lewis
and Lieutenant Clark had seen much of the red
men on the frontier, but now they were in a land
where they found them in their own homes. They
grew accustomed to the round tepees decorated
with bright-colored skins, the necklaces made of
claws of grizzly bears, the head-dresses of eagle
feathers, the tambourines, or small drums that furnished
most of their music, the whip-rattles made of
the hoofs of goats and deer, the white-dressed buffalo
robes painted with pictures that told the history of
the tribe, the moccasins and tobacco pouches embroidered
with many colored beads. Each tribe differed
in some way from its neighbors. For the first
time the explorers found among the Rickarees eight-sided
earth-covered lodges, and basket-shaped boats
made of interwoven boughs covered with buffalo
skins.</p>

<p>Game was plentiful as they went farther up the
Missouri River. At first no buffaloes were found,
but bands of elk were seen, and large herds of goats
crossing from their summer grazing grounds in the
hilly region west of the Missouri to their winter
quarters. Besides these were antelopes, beavers,
bears, badgers, deer, and porcupines, and the river
banks supplied them with plover, grouse, geese,
turkeys, ducks, and pelicans. There were plenty of
wild fruits to be had, and they lived well during the
whole of the summer. They traveled rapidly until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
the approach of cold weather decided them to establish
winter quarters on October 27th.</p>

<p>They pitched their camp, which they called Fort
Mandan, on the eastern shore of the Missouri, near
the present city of Bismarck. They built some
wooden huts, which formed two sides of a triangle,
and a row of pickets on the third side, to provide
them with a stockade in case of attack. They found
a trader of the Hudson's Bay Company near by, and
during the winter a dozen other traders visited them.
Although they appeared to be friendly, Captain
Lewis was convinced that the traders had no desire
to see this United States expedition push into the
country, and would in fact do all they could to
prevent its advance. The Indians in the neighborhood
belonged to the tribes of the Mandans,
Rickarees, and Minnetarees. The first two of these
tribes went to war early in the winter, but peace was
made through the efforts of Captain Lewis. After
that all the Indians visited the encampment, bringing
stores of corn and presents of different sorts, in
exchange for which they obtained beads, rings, and
cloth from the white men. Here Captain Lewis
learned a curious legend of the Mandan tribe.
They believed that all their nation originally lived
in one large village underground near a subterranean
lake, and that a grape-vine stretched its roots
down to their home and gave them a view of daylight.
Some of the more adventurous of the tribe
climbed up the vine, and were delighted with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
sight of the earth, which they found covered with
buffaloes and rich with all kinds of fruits. They
gathered some grapes and returned with them to
their countrymen, and told them of the charms of
the land they had seen. The others were very much
pleased with the story and with the grapes, and
men, women and children started to climb up the
vine. But when only half of them had reached the
top a heavy woman broke the vine by her weight,
and so closed the road to the rest of the nation.
Each member of this tribe was accustomed to select a
particular object for his devotion, and call it his
"medicine." To this they would offer sacrifices of
every kind. One of the Indians said to Captain
Lewis, "I was lately the owner of seventeen horses;
but I have offered them all up to my 'medicine,' and
am now poor." He had actually loosed all his
seventeen horses on the plains, thinking that in that
way he was doing honor to his god.</p>

<p>Almost every day hunting parties left the camp
and brought back buffaloes. The weather grew
very cold in December, and several times the thermometer
fell to forty degrees below zero. As
spring advanced, however, the weather became very
mild, and as early as April 7, 1805, they were able
to leave their camp at Fort Manden and start on
again. The upper Missouri they found was too
shallow for the large barge they had used the
previous summer, so this was now sent back down the
river in charge of a party of ten men who carried letters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
and specimens, while the others embarked in six
canoes and two large open boats that they had built
during the winter. So far the country through
which they had passed had been explored by a few
Hudson's Bay trappers, but as they now turned
westward they came into a region entirely unknown,
which they soon found was almost uninhabited.</p>

<p>The party had by this time three interpreters, one
a Canadian half-breed named Drewyer, who had
inherited from his mother the Indian's skill in woodcraft,
and who also knew the language of the white
explorers. The other two were a man named
Chaboneau and his wife, a young squaw called
Sacajawea, the "Bird-woman," who had originally
belonged to the Snake tribe, but who had been
captured in her childhood by Blackfeet Indians.
This Indian girl had married Chaboneau, a French
wanderer, who like many others of his kind had
sunk into an almost savage state. As the squaw
had not forgotten the language of her native people
the two white leaders thought she would prove a
valuable help to them in the wild country westward,
and persuaded her and her husband to go on with
them.</p>

<p>As the weather was fine the party traveled rapidly,
and by April 26th reached the mouth of the
Yellowstone. They were now very far north, near
the northwest corner of what is the state of North
Dakota. Game was still plentiful but the banks of
the river were covered with a coating of alkali salts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
which made the water of the streams bitter and
unpleasant for drinking. Occasionally they came
upon a deserted Indian camp, but in this northern
territory they found few roving tribes. When there
was a favorable wind they sailed along the Missouri,
but most of the time they had to use their oars.
Early in May they drew up their birch canoes for
the night at the mouth of a stream where they
found a large number of porcupines feeding on
young willow trees. Captain Lewis christened the
stream Porcupine River. Here there were quantities
of game, and elk and buffalo in abundance, so that
it was an easy matter to provide food for all the party.</p>

<p>Now they were continually coming upon new
rivers, many of them broad, with swift-flowing currents,
and all of them appealing to the love of
exploration. The Missouri was their highroad,
however, and so they simply stopped to name the
different streams they came to. One they passed
had a peculiar white color, and Captain Lewis called
it the Milk River. The country along this stream
was bare for some distance, with gradually rising
hills beyond.</p>

<p>The game here was very plentiful and the buffaloes
were so tame that the men were obliged to drive
them away with sticks and stones. The only dangerous
animal was the grizzly bear, a beast that never
seemed to know when he had had enough of a fight.
One evening the men in the canoes saw a large
grizzly lying some three hundred paces from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
shore. Six of them landed and hid behind a small
hillock within forty paces of the bear; four of the
hunters fired, and each lodged a ball in the bear's
body. The animal sprang up and roared furiously
at them. As he came near them the two hunters
who had not yet fired gave him two more wounds,
one of which broke a shoulder, but before they had
time to reload their guns, the bear was so near them
that they had to run for the river. He almost overtook
them; two jumped into the canoes; the other
four separated, and hiding in the willows fired as
fast as they could reload their guns. Again and
again they shot him, but each time the shots only
seemed to attract his attention toward the hunters,
until finally he chased two of them so closely that
they threw away their guns, and jumped down a
steep bank into the river. The bear sprang after
them, and was almost on top of the rear man when
one of the others on shore shot him in the head, and
finally killed him. They dragged him to shore,
and found that eight balls had gone through him in
different directions. The hunters took the bear's
skin back to camp, and there they learned that another
adventure had occurred. One of the other
canoes, which contained all the provisions, instruments,
and numerous other important articles, had
been under sail when it was struck on the side by a
sudden squall of wind. The man at the helm, who
was one of the worst navigators of the party, made
the mistake of luffing the boat into the wind. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
wind was so high that it forced the brace of the
square-sail out of the hand of the man who was holding
it, and instantly upset the canoe. The boat
would have turned upside down but for the resistance
of the canvas awning. The other boats hastened
to the rescue, righted the canoe, and by baling her
out kept her from sinking. They rowed the canoe
to shore and the cargo was saved. Had it been lost
the expedition would have been deprived of most of
the things that were necessary for its success, at a
distance of between two and three thousand miles
from any place where they could get supplies.</p>

<p>On May 20th they reached the yellowish waters of
the Musselshell River. A short distance beyond this
Captain Lewis caught his first view of the Rocky
Mountains, one of the goals toward which they were
tending. Along the Musselshell the country was
covered with wild roses and small honeysuckle, but
soon after they came into a region that was very bare
and dry, where both game and timber were scarce,
the mosquitoes annoying, the noonday sun uncomfortably
hot, and the nights very cold. The Missouri
River, along which they were still traveling, was
now heading to the southwest. They were near the
border of the present state of Idaho when they passed
several old Indian camps, most of which seemed to
have been deserted for five or six weeks. From this
fact they judged that they were following a band of
about one hundred lodges, who were traveling up the
same river. They knew that the Minnetarees of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
Missouri often traveled as far west as the Yellowstone,
and presumed that the Indians ahead of them
belonged to that tribe. There were other evidences
of the Indians. At the foot of a cliff they found the
bodies of a great many slaughtered buffaloes, which
had been hunted after the fashion of the Blackfeet.
Their way of hunting was to select one of the most
active braves, and disguise him by tying a buffalo
skin around his body, fastening the skin of the head,
with ears and horns, over the head of the brave.
Thus disguised the Indian would take a position between
a herd of buffalo and the precipice overlooking
a river. The other hunters would steal back of
the herd, and at a given signal chase them. The
buffaloes would run in the direction of the disguised
brave, who would lead them on at full speed toward
the river. As he reached the edge he would quickly
hide himself in some crevice or ravine of the cliff,
which he had chosen beforehand, and the herd would
be left on the brink. The buffaloes in front could
not stop being driven on by those behind, who in
their turn would be closely pursued by the hunters.
The whole herd, therefore, would usually rush over
the cliff, and the hunters could take their pick of
hides and meat in the river below. This method of
hunting was very extravagant, but at that time the
Indians had no thought of preserving the buffaloes.
One of the rivers Lewis passed in this region he
named the Slaughter River, on account of this way
of hunting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
When the Missouri turned southward the explorers
came to many steep rapids, around which the canoes
had to be carried, which made traveling slow. Often
the banks were so steep and the mud so thick that
the men were obliged to take off their moccasins, and
much of the time they were up to their arms in the
cold water of the river. But there was a great deal
to charm the eye in the opening spring, even in that
bare country. Lewis found places near the river
filled with choke-cherries, yellow currants, wild
roses, and prickly pears in full bloom. In the distance
the mountains, rising in long greenish-blue
chains, the tops covered with snow, invited the
travelers to find what lay on the other side of their
ridges.</p>

<p>On June 3d they reached a place where the river
divided into two wide streams, and it became very
important to decide which of the two was the one
that the Indians called the Ahmateahza, or Missouri,
which they had said approached very near to the
Columbia River. Lewis knew that the success of
his expedition depended largely upon choosing the
right stream, because if, after they had ascended the
Rocky Mountains beyond, they should find that the
river they had taken did not bring them near the
Columbia, they would have to return, and thereby
would lose a large part of the summer, which was
the only season when they could travel. For this
reason he decided to send out two exploring parties.
He himself made a two days' march up the north<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
branch, and deciding that this was not the Missouri,
he named it Maria's River. As they came back
they had to walk along high cliffs, and at one steep
point Captain Lewis slipped, and, if he had not been
able to catch himself with his mountain stick, would
have been thrown into the river. He had just
reached a point of safety when he heard a man behind
him call out, "Good God, captain, what shall I
do?" Turning instantly he found that his companion
had lost his footing on the narrow pass, and had
slipped down to the very edge of the precipice,
where he lay with his right arm and leg over the
cliff, while with the other arm and leg he was trying
to keep from slipping over. Lewis saw the danger,
but calmly told the other to take his knife from his
belt with his right hand, and dig a hole in the side
of the bluff in which to stick his foot. With great
presence of mind the man did this, and getting a
foothold, raised himself on his knees. Lewis then
told him to take off his moccasins, and crawl forward
on his hands and knees, his knife in one hand and
his rifle in the other. In this manner the man regained
a secure place on the cliff.</p>

<p>Captain Lewis considered that this method of
traveling was too dangerous, and he ordered the rest
of the party to wade the river at the foot of the bluff,
where the water was only breast-high. This adventure
taught them the danger of crossing the slippery
heights above the stream, but as the plains
were broken by ravines almost as difficult to pass,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
they kept on down the river, sometimes wading in
the mud of the low grounds, sometimes in the water,
but when that became too deep, cutting footholds in
the river bank with their knives. On that particular
day they traveled through rain, mud, and water for
eighteen miles, and at night camped in a deserted
Indian lodge built of sticks. Here they cooked part
of the six deer they had killed in the day's traveling,
and slept on willow boughs they piled inside the
lodge.</p>

<p>Many of the party thought that the north fork was
the Missouri River, but Lewis and Clark were both
convinced that the south fork was the real Missouri.
They therefore hid their heaviest boat and all the
supplies they could spare, and prepared to push on
with as little burden as possible. A few days later
Lewis was proved to be right in his judgment of
the south fork, for on June 13th he came to the
Great Falls of the Missouri. The grandeur of the
falls made a tremendous impression on them all.
The river, three hundred yards wide, was shut in by
steep cliffs, and for ninety yards from the left cliff
the water fell in a smooth sheet over a precipice
of eighty feet. The rest of the river shot forward
with greater force, and, being broken by projecting
rocks, sent clouds of foam into the air. As the
water struck the basin below the falls it beat furiously
against the ledge of rocks that extended across the
river, and Lewis found that for three miles below the
stream was one line of rapids and cascades, overhung<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
by bluffs. Five miles above the first falls the
whole river was blocked by one straight shelf of
rock, over which the water ran in an even sheet, a
majestic sight.</p>

<p>This part of the Missouri, however, offered great
difficulties to their travel. The men had now journeyed
constantly for several months, and were in a
region of steep falls and rapids. It was clear that
they could not carry the boats on their shoulders for
long distances. Fortunately they found a small
creek at the foot of the falls, and by this they were
able to reach the highlands. From there Lieutenant
Clark and a few men surveyed the trail they were to
follow, while others hunted and prepared stores of
dried meat, and the carpenter built a carriage to
transport the boats. They found a large cottonwood
tree, about twenty-two inches in diameter, which
provided them with the carriage wheels. They decided
to leave one of their boats behind, and use its
mast for two axle-trees.</p>

<p>Meantime Clark studied the river and found that
a series of rapids made a perilous descent, and that
a portage of thirteen miles would be necessary. The
country was difficult for traveling, being covered
with patches of prickly pears, the needles of which
cut through the moccasins of the men who dragged
the boat's carriage. To add to the difficulty, when
they were about five miles from their goal the axle-trees
broke, and then the tongues of green cottonwood
gave way. They had to stop and search for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
a substitute, and finally found willow trees, which
provided them with enough wood to patch up the
boat-carriage. Half a mile from their new camping
place the carriage broke again, and this time they
found it easier to carry boat and baggage than to
build a new conveyance. Captain Lewis described
the state of his party at this portage. "The men,"
he wrote, "are loaded as heavily as their strength
will permit; the crossing is really painful; some are
limping with the soreness of their feet, others are
scarcely able to stand for more than a few minutes
from the heat and fatigue; they are all obliged to
halt and rest frequently, and at almost every stopping
place they fall, and many of them are asleep in
an instant."</p>

<p>As they had to go back to the other side of the
rapids for the stores they had left, they were obliged
to repair the carriage and cross the portage again
and again. After ten days' work all their stores
were above the falls.</p>

<p>While they were busy making this portage they
had several narrow escapes from attacks by grizzly
bears. The bears were so bold that they would walk
into the camp at night, attracted by buffalo meat,
and the sleeping men were in danger from their
claws. A tremendous storm added to their discomfort,
and the hailstones were driven so furiously by
the high wind that they wounded some of the men.
Before the storm Lieutenant Clark, with his colored
servant York, the half-breed Chaboneau, and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
Indian wife and young child, had taken the road
above the falls on their way to camp when they
noticed a very dark cloud coming up rapidly in the
west. Clark hunted about for shelter, and at length
found a ravine protected by shelving rocks under
which they could take refuge. Here they were safe
from the rain, and they laid down their guns, compass,
and the other articles they had with them.
Rain and hail beat upon their shelter, and the rain
began to fall in such solid sheets that it washed down
rocks and mud from higher up the ravine. Then a
landslide started, but just before the heaviest part of
it struck them Lieutenant Clark seized his gun in
one hand, and pushed the Indian woman, her child
in her arms, up the bank. Her husband also caught
at her and pulled her along, but he was so much
frightened at the noise and danger that but for
Clark's steadiness he, with his wife and child, would
probably have been lost. As it was, Clark could
hardly climb as fast as the water rose. Had they
waited a minute longer they would have been swept
into the Missouri just above the Great Falls. They
reached the top in safety, and there found York,
who had left them just before the storm to hunt some
buffalo. They pushed on to camp where the rest of
the party had already taken shelter, and had abandoned
all work for that day.</p>

<p>While the men were building a new boat of skins,
Captain Lewis spent much time studying the animals,
trees, and plants of the region, making records of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
to take home. Ever since their arrival at the falls
they had heard a strange noise coming from the
mountains a little to the north of west. "It is heard
at different periods of the day and night," Lewis
wrote, "sometimes when the air is perfectly still and
without a cloud, and consists of one stroke only, or
of five or six discharges in quick succession. It is
loud, and resembles precisely the sound of a six-pound
piece of ordnance at the distance of three
miles. The Minnetarees frequently mentioned this
noise like thunder, which they said the mountains
made; but we paid no attention to it, believing it to
have been some superstition, or perhaps a falsehood.
The watermen also of the party say that the Pawnees
and Ricaras give the same account of a noise heard
in the Black Mountains to the westward of them.
The solution of the mystery given by the philosophy
of the watermen is, that it is occasioned by the
bursting of the rich mines of silver confined within
the bosom of the mountain."</p>

<p>Early in July the new boat was finished. It was
very strong, and yet could be carried easily by five
men. But when it was first launched they found
that the tar-like material with which they had
covered the skins that made the body of the boat
would not withstand water, and so the craft leaked.
After trying to repair the boat for several days they
finally decided to abandon it. Putting all their
luggage into the canoes they resumed their journey
up the river.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
As the canoes were heavily loaded the men who
were not needed to paddle them walked along the
shore. The country here was very picturesque. At
times they climbed hills that gave them wide views
of open country never explored by white men; again
they waded through fields of wild rye, reminding
them of the farm lands of the East; sometimes their
path wound through forests of redwood trees, and
always they could see the high mountains, still snow-capped.
The glistening light on the mountain tops
told the explorers why they were called the Shining
Mountains.</p>

<p>Game was now less plentiful, and as they had to
save the dried meat for the crossing of the mountains,
it became a problem to provide food for the
party of thirty-two people, who usually consumed a
daily supply equal to an elk and deer, four deer or one
buffalo. The wild berries, however, were now ripe,
and as there were quantities of these they helped to
furnish the larder. There were red, purple, yellow,
and black currants, gooseberries, and service-berries.
The sunflower grew everywhere. Lewis
wrote in his diary: "The Indians of the Missouri,
more especially those who do not cultivate maize,
make great use of the seed of this plant for bread or
in thickening their soup. They first parch and then
pound it between two stones until it is reduced to a
fine meal. Sometimes they add a portion of water,
and drink it thus diluted; at other times they add a
sufficient proportion of marrow grease to reduce it to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
the consistency of common dough and eat it in that
manner. This last composition we preferred to all
the rest, and thought it at that time a very palatable
dish."</p>

<p>The Missouri now flowed to the south, and on July
18th the party reached a wide stream, which they
named Dearborn River in honor of the Secretary
of War. Lewis meant to send back a small
party in canoes from this point, but as he had not yet
met the Snake Indians, and was uncertain as to their
friendliness, he decided he had better not weaken
his expedition here. He, however, sent Clark with
three men on a scouting trip. Clark found an old
Indian road, which he followed, but the prickly pears
cut the feet of his men so badly that he could not
go far. Along his track he strewed signals, pieces
of cloth and paper, to show the Indians, if they should
cross that trail, that the party was composed of white
men. Before he returned the main party had discovered
a great column of smoke up the valley, and
suspected that this was an Indian signal to show that
their approach had been discovered. Afterward
they learned that this was the fact. The Indians
had heard one of Clark's men fire a gun, and, taking
alarm, had fled into the mountains, giving the smoke
signal to warn the rest of the tribe.</p>

<p>The high mountains now began to draw close to
the expedition, and they camped one night at a
place called the Gates of the Rocky Mountains.
Here tremendous rocks rose directly from the river's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
edge almost twelve hundred feet in the air; at the
base they were made of black granite, but the upper
part Lewis decided was probably flint of a yellowish
brown and cream color. On July 25th the advance
guard reached the three forks of the Missouri.
Chaboneau was ill, and they had to wait until Lewis
and the others caught up. They named the forks of
the river Gallatin, Madison, and Jefferson, in honor
of the statesmen of those names. It was at this
place that the Indian squaw Sacajawea had been in
camp with her tribe five years before when the
Minnetarees attacked them, killed some, and made a
prisoner of her and some others. Lewis hoped that
she would be able to help them if they should fall in
with bands of her own tribe.</p>

<p>As the main stream ended here, the party now followed
the Jefferson River. They soon decided that
it would be necessary to secure horses if they were
to cross the mountains, and Lewis with three men
set out to try to find the Shoshone Indians, from
whom they might buy mounts. After several hours'
march they saw a man on horseback coming across
the plain toward them; examining him through the
glass Lewis decided that he belonged to a different
tribe of Indians from any that they had yet met, probably
the Shoshones. He was armed with a bow and
a quiver of arrows, and rode a good horse without a
saddle, a small string attached to the lower jaw answering
as a bridle. Lewis was anxious to convince
him that the white men meant to be friendly, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
went toward him at his usual pace. When they
were still some distance apart the Indian suddenly
stopped. Lewis immediately stopped also, and
taking his blanket from his knapsack, and holding
it with both hands at the four corners threw it
above his head and then unfolded it as he brought
it to the ground, as if in the act of spreading it.
This signal, which was intended to represent the
spreading of a robe as a seat for guests, was the
common sign of friendship among the Indian tribes
of the Missouri and the Rocky Mountains. Lewis
repeated the sign three times, and then taking some
beads, a looking-glass, and a few other trinkets
from his knapsack, and leaving his gun, walked on
toward the Indian. But when he was within two hundred
yards of him the Indian turned his horse and
began to ride away. Captain Lewis then called to
him, using words of the Shoshones. The captain's
companions now walked forward, also, and their advance
evidently frightened the Indian, for he suddenly
whipped his horse and disappeared in a clump
of willow bushes. When they returned to the camp
Lewis packed some more Indian gifts in his knapsack,
and fastened a small United States flag to a
pole to be carried by one of the men, which was
intended as a friendly signal should the Indians
see them advancing.</p>

<p>The next day brought them to the head-waters of
the Jefferson River, rising from low mountains.
They had now reached the sources of the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
Missouri River, a place never before seen by white
men. From this distant spot flowed the waters that
traversed a third of the continent, finally flowing into
the Mississippi near St. Louis.</p>

<p>Leaving the river, they followed an Indian road
through the hills, and reached the top of a ridge
from which they could see more mountains, partly
covered with snow. The ridge on which they stood
marked the dividing line between the waters of the
Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans. Going down the
farther side they came to a creek, which was part of
the Columbia River; near this was a spring. They
gathered enough dry willow brush for fuel, and
halted for the night. Here they ate their last piece
of pork, and had only a little flour and parched meal
left in the way of provisions. Early next day Lewis
went forward on foot, hoping to find some Indians.
After several hours he saw three; but they fled away.
Later he came upon three Indian women; one of them
ran, but the other two, an elderly woman and a little
girl, approached, evidently thinking that the strangers
were too near for them to escape, and sat down on
the ground. Lewis put down his rifle and walking
to them, took the woman by the hand, and helped
her up. He then rolled up his shirt sleeve to show
that he was a white man, since his hands and face
were almost as dark as an Indian's. His companions
joined him, and they gave the Indians some pewter
mirrors, beads, and other presents. He painted the
women's cheeks with some vermilion paint, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
was the Shoshone custom, meaning peace. He then
made them understand by signs that he wished to
go to their camp to see their chiefs. The squaw led
the white men along a road for some two miles, when
they met a band of sixty mounted warriors riding
toward them. Again Lewis dropped his rifle, and
courageously marched out to deal with these unknown
red men. The chief and two others galloped
up in advance and spoke to the women, who
showed them the presents they had just received.
Then the three Indians leaped from their horses, and
coming up to Lewis, put their arms about him in
friendly greeting, at the same time rubbing their
cheeks against his and smearing considerable paint
on his face. The other white men advanced and
were greeted in the same way. Lewis gave presents
to the warriors, and, lighting a pipe, offered it to
them for the "smoke of peace." Before they smoked
it, however, the Indians took off their moccasins, a
custom which meant that they would go barefooted
forever, before they broke their treaty of
friendship with their friends. The chief then turned
and led the white men and his warriors to their
camp. Here the white men were invited into a
leathern lodge, and seated on green boughs and
antelope skins. A small fire was lit in the centre.
Again taking off their moccasins, the chief lighted
a pipe made of some highly polished green stone;
after some words in his own tongue he handed the
pipe to Captain Lewis, who then handed it to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
other white men. Each took a few whiffs, and then
passed it back to the warriors. After this ceremony
was finished, Lewis explained that they were in great
need of food. The chief presented them with cakes
made of sun-dried service-berries and choke-cherries.
Later another warrior gave them a piece of boiled
antelope, and some fresh roasted salmon, the first
salmon Lewis had seen, which convinced him that
he was now on the waters of the Columbia River.
He learned that the Indians had received word of
the advance of his party, whom they at first took to
be a hostile tribe, and had therefore set out, prepared
for an attack. As a further sign of good-will,
the white men were invited to witness an Indian
dance, which lasted nearly all night. It was
late when the white men, tired by their long day's
journey, were allowed to take their rest.</p>

<p>On the next day Captain Lewis tried to persuade
the Shoshones to accompany him across the divide
in order to assist in bringing his baggage over. It
took considerable argument to get the Indians to do
this, and he had to promise them more gifts and
arouse their curiosity by telling them that there were
a black man and a native Indian woman in his camp,
before he could induce them to consent. Finally
the chief, Cameahwait, and several of his warriors
agreed to go with Lewis. When they reached the
place where the rest of the party were camped
the chief was surprised and delighted to find
that the Indian woman, Sacajawea, was his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
sister, whom he had not seen since she had been
captured by the enemies of his tribe. Clark's negro
servant, York, caused much amazement to the
Indians, who had never seen a man of his color
before. Lewis then had a long talk with the
Shoshones, telling them of the great power of the
government he represented, and of the advantages
they would receive by trading with the white men.
Presently he won their good-will, and they agreed
to give him four horses in exchange for firearms
and other articles. Sacajawea was of the greatest
help in the talk between the white men and the Shoshones,
and it was she who finally induced her brother
to do all he could to assist the explorers.</p>

<p>Lewis now sent Clark ahead to explore the route
along the Columbia River, and to build canoes if
possible. The Indians had told him that their road
would lie over steep, rocky mountains, where there
would be little or no game, and then for ten days
across a sandy desert. Clark pushed on, and found
all the Indians' reports correct. He met a few small
parties of Indians, but they had no provisions to
spare, and his men were soon exhausted from hunger
and the weariness of marching over mountains.
His expedition proved that it would be impossible
for the main party to follow this river, to which he
gave the name of Lewis, and he returned to the
camp of the Shoshones, which Lewis and the others
had made their headquarters.</p>

<p>In this camp the white men made preparations for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
the rest of their journey. They finally obtained
twenty-nine young horses and saddles for them.
They also studied the history and habits of this
tribe, who had once been among the most powerful,
but had been lately defeated in battle by their neighbors.
The Shoshones were also called the Snake
Indians, and lived along the rivers of the northwest,
fishing for salmon and hunting buffaloes. Their
chief wealth lay in their small, wiry horses, which
were very sure-footed and fleet, and to which they
paid a great deal of attention.</p>

<p>On August 27th the expedition started afresh,
with twenty-nine packhorses, heading across the
mountains to other Indian encampments on another
branch of the Columbia. Travel was slow, as in
many places they had to cut a road for the ponies,
and often the path was so rough that the heavily-burdened
horses would slip and fall. Snow fell at
one time, and added to the difficulty of the journey,
but by September 6th they had passed the mountain
range, and had come into a wide valley, at
the head of a stream they called Clark's Fork of the
Columbia. Here they met about four hundred
Ootlashoot Indians, to whom they gave presents in
exchange for fresh horses. Continuing again, they
reached Traveler's Rest Creek, and here they
stopped to hunt, as the Indians had told them that
the country ahead held no game. After refurnishing
their larder they pushed on westward, and ran into
another snow-storm, which made riding more difficult<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
than ever. Their provisions were soon exhausted,
game was lacking, and the situation was
discouraging. The march had proved very tiring,
and there was no immediate prospect of reaching
better country. Lewis, therefore, sent Clark with
six hunters ahead, but this light scouting party
was able to find very little game, and was nearly
exhausted, when on September 20th Clark came
upon a village of the Chopunish or Nez Percés
Indians, in a beautiful valley. These Indians had
fish, roots, and berries, which they gave the white
men, who at once sent some back to Lewis and
the others. These provisions reached the main
party at a time when they had been without food for
more than a day. Strengthened by the supplies,
and encouraged by news of the Indian village, they
hastened forward, and reached the Nez Percés' encampment.</p>

<p>Their stock of firearms and small articles enabled
them to buy provisions from these Indians; and
they moved on to the forks of the Snake River,
where they camped for several days, to enable the
party to regain its strength. They built five canoes
in the Indian fashion, and launched them on the
river, which they hoped would lead them to the
ocean. Lewis hid his saddles and extra ammunition,
and, having branded the horses, turned them over
to three Indians, who agreed to take care of them
until the party should return.</p>

<p>The Snake River, flowing through beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
country, was filled with rapids, and they had many
hardships in passing them. At one place a canoe
struck a rock, and immediately filled with water and
sank. Several of the men could not swim, and were
rescued with difficulty. At the same time they had
to guard their supplies carefully at night from
wandering Indians, who, although they were
friendly, could not resist the temptation to steal
small articles of all sorts. The rapids passed, the
river brought them into the main stream of the
Lewis River, and this in turn led them to the junction
of the Lewis and Columbia Rivers, which
they reached on October 17th. Here they parted
from the last of the Nez Percés Indians. The
Columbia had as many rapids as the smaller river,
and in addition they came to the Great Falls, where
they had to lower the canoes by ropes made of elkskin.
At one or two places they had to make
portages, but as this involved a great deal of extra
labor, they tried to keep to the stream wherever they
could. At one place a tremendous rock jutted into
the river, leaving a channel only forty-five yards wide
through which the Columbia passed, its waters
tossed into great whirlpools and wild currents.
Lewis decided that it would be impossible to carry
the boats over this high rock, and determined to
rely on skillful steering of them through the narrow
passage. He succeeded in doing this, although
Indians whom he had met shortly before had told
him that it was impossible. At several places they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
landed most of the men and all the valuable articles,
and the two chief explorers took the canoes through
the rapids themselves, not daring to trust the navigation
to less experienced hands.</p>

<p>In this far-western country they were continually
meeting wandering Indians, and they learned from
them that the Pacific Ocean was not far distant. On
October 28th Lewis found an Indian wearing a
round hat and sailor's jacket, which had been brought
up the river in trade, and soon after he found other
red men wearing white men's clothes. On the thirty-first
they came to more falls. Here they followed
the example of their Indian friends, and carried the
canoes and baggage across the slippery rocks to the
foot of the rapids. The large canoes were brought
down by slipping them along on poles, which were
stretched from one rock to another. They had to
stop constantly to make repairs to the boats, which
had weathered all sorts of currents, and had been
buffeted against innumerable rocks and tree-trunks.
Then they discovered tide-water in the river, and
pushed on eagerly to a place called Diamond Island.
Here, Lewis wrote, "we met fifteen Indians ascending
the river in two canoes; but the only information
we could procure from them was that they had seen
three vessels, which we presumed to be European, at
the mouth of the Columbia."</p>

<p>They came to more and more Indian villages, generally
belonging to the Skilloot tribe, who were very
friendly, but who were too sharp at a bargain to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
please Captain Lewis. On November 7, 1805, they
reached a point from which they could see the ocean.
Lewis says: "The fog cleared off, and we enjoyed
the delightful prospect of the ocean&mdash;that ocean, the
object of all our labors, the reward of all our anxieties.
This cheering view exhilarated the spirits of all
the party, who were still more delighted on hearing
the distant roar of the breakers, and went on with
great cheerfulness."</p>

<p>It was late in the year, and the captain wished to
push on so that he might winter on the coast, but a
heavy storm forced them to land and seek refuge
under a high cliff. The waves on the river were
very high, and the wind was blowing a gale directly
from the sea; great waves broke over the place
where they camped, and they had to use the utmost
care to save their canoes from being smashed by
drifting logs. Here they had to stay for six days, in
which time their clothes and food were drenched, and
their supply of dried fish exhausted; but the men
bore these trials lightly now that they were so near
the Pacific Ocean. When the gale ended they explored
the country for a good place to establish their
winter quarters. The captain finally decided to
locate on a point of high land above the river Neutel,
well beyond the highest tide, and protected by a
grove of lofty pines. Here they made their permanent
camp, which was called Fort Clatsop. They
built seven wooden huts in which to spend the winter.
They lived chiefly on elk, to which they added fish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
and berries in the early spring. A whale stranded on
the beach provided them with blubber, and they
found salt on the shore. The winter passed without
any unusual experiences, and gave the captain an
opportunity to make a full record of the country
through which he had passed, and of the Indian
tribes he had met.</p>

<p>The original plan was to remain at Fort Clatsop
until April, when Lewis expected to renew his stock
of merchandise from the trading vessels, which visited
the mouth of the Columbia every spring; but as the
winter passed the constant rain brought sickness
among the men, and game grew more and more
scarce, so that it was decided to make an earlier return.
Before they did this Lewis wrote out an account
of his expedition, and arranged to have this
delivered to the trading vessels when they should arrive,
and in this way the news of his discoveries
would not be lost in case anything should happen to
his own party. The Indians agreed to deliver the
packets, and one of the messages, carried by an
American trader, finally reached Boston by way of
China in February, 1807, some six months after
Lewis himself had returned to the East. On March
24, 1806, they started back on their long route of
four thousand one hundred and forty-four miles to
St. Louis.</p>

<p>Searching for fish, they found the Multonah or
Willamette River, and Lewis wrote that the valley of
this stream would furnish the only desirable place of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
settlement west of the Rocky Mountains. Here he
found rich prairies, plenty of fish and game, unusual
plants of various sorts, and abundant timber. Soon
they reached the village of the Walla Walla Indians,
who received them so hospitably that the captain
said of all the Indians they had met since leaving the
United States this tribe was the most honest and
sincere. With twenty-three horses, and Walla Walla
Indians as guides, they followed a new road up the
valley of the Lewis or Snake River, which saved
them eighty miles of their westward route. It was
still too early to cross the mountains, and they camped
near the place where they had trusted their thirty-eight
horses to their Indian friends the autumn before.
The Indians returned the horses in exchange for
merchandise, and Lewis provided them with food.
In all these meetings the squaw wife of the French
trader was invaluable. Usually Lewis spoke in English,
which was translated by one of his men into
French for the benefit of the trapper Chaboneau, who
repeated it in the tongue of the Minnetarees to his
wife; she would then repeat the words in the Shoshone
tongue, and most of the Indians could then
understand them, or some could repeat them to the
others in their own dialect.</p>

<p>Early in June they tried to cross the mountains,
but the snow was ten feet deep on a level, and they
had to abandon the attempt until late in the month.
They finally crossed, and found their trail of the
previous September. At this point the party divided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
in order to explore different parts of the country.
Lewis took a direct road to the Great Falls of the Missouri,
where he wished to explore Maria's River.
Clark went on to the head of the Jefferson River,
where he was to find the canoes that they had hidden,
and cross by the shortest route to the Yellowstone;
and the two parties were to meet at the
mouth of the Yellowstone River. Lack of game
prevented Lewis getting far into the country along
Maria's River. On this journey he fell in with a
band of Minnetarees, and some of them tried to steal
his guns and horses. The only real fight of the
journey followed, in which two Indians were killed.
He then continued eastward, and on August 7th
reached the mouth of the Yellowstone, where he
found a note telling him that Clark had camped a
few miles below.</p>

<p>In the meantime Clark had explored a large part
of the valleys of the Jefferson, Gallatin, and Madison
Rivers, and had found a boiling-hot spring at the
head of the Wisdom River, one of the first signs of
the wonders of the Yellowstone. His journey was
made safely and comfortably, although at one place
he had to stop to build fresh canoes, and during this
delay a band of Indians stole twenty-four of his
packhorses.</p>

<p>The united party descended the Missouri, and
found that other explorers were already following in
their track. They met two men from Illinois who
had pushed as far west as the Yellowstone on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
hunting trip, and back of them they heard of hunters
and trappers who were pushing into this unexplored
region. Travel homeward was rapid, and
on September 23, 1806, the expedition arrived at
St. Louis, from which they had started two years
and four months before. At the place where they
parted with the last of the Minnetarees they said
goodbye to Chaboneau, his Indian wife, and child.
The squaw had been of the greatest service to them;
but for her it is possible that the expedition might
never have been able to get through the Shoshone
country. Lewis offered to take the three to the
United States, but the French trader said that he preferred
to remain among the Indians. He was paid
five hundred dollars, which included the price of a
horse and lodge that had been purchased from him.</p>

<p>The wonderful journey had been a complete success.
The explorers had passed through strange
tribes of Indians, dangers from hunger and hardship
in the high mountains, the desert, and the plains,
and had brought back a remarkable record of the
scenes and people they had met. From their reports
the people of the United States first learned
the true value of that great Louisiana Territory,
which had been bought for such a small price in
money, but which was to furnish homesteads for
thousands of pioneers. The work begun by the
brave French explorers of earlier centuries was
brought to a triumphant close by these two native
American discoverers.</p>

<h2><a name="III" id="III">III</a><br />
<br />
<span class="larger">THE CONSPIRACY OF AARON BURR</span></h2>

<p>There is a small island in the Ohio River, two
miles below the town of Parkersburg, that is still
haunted with the memory of a strange conspiracy.
In 1805 the island, then some three hundred acres in
size, belonged to an Irish gentleman, Harman Blennerhassett,
who had built a beautiful home there and
planted fields of hemp. For a time he and his
family lived there in great content, Blennerhassett
himself being devoted to science and to music, but
presently he felt the need of increasing his small
fortune and looked about for a suitable enterprise.
Then there was introduced to him a gentleman from
New York, a very well-known man by the name of
Aaron Burr. He also was seeking to make his fortune,
and he took Blennerhassett into his confidence.
Together they plotted a conspiracy. They started
to put their plans into action, and many people
called them patriots, and many called them traitors.
History does not know all the secrets of that small
island, but it tells a curious story of the conspiracy.</p>

<p>Aaron Burr was a very talented and fascinating
man, but he was a born adventurer. At this time
he was about fifty years old. He had fought in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
Revolution, and practiced law in New York City,
where he divided honors with Alexander Hamilton,
the most brilliant attorney of the period. He had
been elected a senator, and then had become a candidate
for President of the United States. In the
election of 1800 the Electoral College cast seventy-three
votes apiece for Thomas Jefferson and Aaron
Burr, and these two candidates led all the others.
As there was a tie, the choice of President was
thrown into the House of Representatives, and
there followed a long and bitter fight. Finally Jefferson
was chosen President, and Burr Vice-President.
In the long campaign Burr made many
enemies, chief among whom were the powerful New
York families of Clinton and Livingston. These
men charged him with being a political trickster, and
won most of his followers away from him. When
Burr became a candidate for Governor of New York
he was beaten, and his defeat was made more bitter
by the stinging attacks of his old rival, Alexander
Hamilton.</p>

<p>In that day it was still the custom for gentlemen
to settle questions of honor on the dueling field.
Burr, stung by Hamilton's criticisms, challenged
him, and the two met on the heights of Weehawken,
overlooking the Hudson River. Here Burr
wounded Hamilton so severely that the latter died a
few days later. Hounded by Hamilton's friends,
the luckless Burr now found himself cast out by
both the Federalists and Republicans, and with no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
political future. Yet he knew that he had unusual
talents for leadership. Still filled with ambition and
in great need of money, he saw that there was little
opportunity for him at home, and began to turn his
eyes outside of the Republic.</p>

<p>The western world was then a wonderful field for
daring adventurers. Thirteen small colonies lying
close to the Atlantic Ocean had less than twenty
years before thrown off the yoke of a great European
nation. Men had already pushed west to the
Mississippi, and settled the fertile fields beyond the
Alleghanies. Across the great "Mother of Rivers"
lay a vast tract that men knew little about. To the
south lay Spanish colonies and islands. The Gulf of
Mexico was the home of freebooters and pirates.
In Europe a man of the people named Napoleon
Bonaparte was carving out an empire for himself,
and stirring the blood of all ambitious men. Soldiers
of fortune everywhere were wondering
whether they might not follow in Napoleon's footsteps.</p>

<p>It is hard to say in which direction Burr was
tempted first. He wanted to hide his real plans not
only from his own countrymen, but from the English,
French, and Spanish agents as well. He first
pretended to Anthony Merry, the British minister at
Washington, that he intended to join a conspiracy
to start a revolution in the Spanish colonies, in the
hope of turning them into a new republic. Mr.
Merry told his government that it would be to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
advantage of England if Mr. Burr's plans succeeded.
But even then Burr was working on a different
scheme. He thought that the people of Louisiana,
a large territory at the mouth of the Mississippi
River, which had only lately become a part of the
United States, might be induced to separate into a
new nation of their own. He needed money for his
plans, and so he kept pointing out to the British
minister the many advantages to England if either
the Spanish colonies or Louisiana should win freedom.
A third plan was also dawning in Burr's
mind, the possibility of entering Mexico and carving
out a kingdom there for himself. So he began by
dealing with the agents of different countries, trying
to get money from each for his own secret schemes.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1805 Burr set out for the West.
He took coach for the journey over the mountains
to Pittsburgh, where he had arranged by letter to
meet General James Wilkinson, the governor of the
new territory of Louisiana. Wilkinson was delayed,
however, and so Burr embarked in an ark that he
had ordered built to sail down the Ohio River.
After several days on the water he reached Blennerhassett
Island early in May. The owner of the
island was away from home, but his wife invited
Burr to their house, and he learned from her that
her husband was looking for a way to mend his
fortunes.</p>

<p>Next day Burr continued his journey in the ark.
He reached Cincinnati, then a very small town of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
fifteen hundred people, where he talked over his
plans with several friends. From Cincinnati he
went to Louisville, and from there rode to Frankfort.
At Nashville he was the guest of Andrew Jackson,
who was major-general of the Tennessee militia.
Word spread about that Aaron Burr was plotting to
free Florida and the West Indies from Spanish
rule, and the liberty-loving settlers welcomed him
with open arms.</p>

<p>Leaving Andrew Jackson, Burr floated in an open
boat to the mouth of the Cumberland River, where
his ark, which had come down the Ohio, was waiting
for him. The ark made its first stop at a frontier
post called Fort Massac, and there Burr met General
Wilkinson of Louisiana. These two men were
real soldiers of fortune. They had fought side by
side at the walls of Quebec, and Wilkinson, like
many another, had fallen under the spell of Burr's
charm. They probably discussed the whole situation:
how a small army might seize Florida, how a
small navy could drive the Spaniards from Cuba,
how a daring band of frontiersmen could march
from Vera Cruz to the city of Mexico. Wilkinson
seemed delighted with Burr's schemes, and when he
left he provided his friend with a large barge
manned by ten soldiers and a sergeant.</p>

<p>In this imposing vessel Burr sailed on down the Mississippi
to New Orleans, and on June 25, 1805, landed
at that quaint old city. It was already a place of
much importance; seagoing ships and thousands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
of river flatboats docked at its levees, for it was the
chief port for sending goods to Mexico and the
other Spanish colonies. Burr brought letters to
many prominent people, and a public dinner was
given in his honor. The visitor had been Vice-President
of the United States, and was said to be
the leader of a band of mysterious patriots. Enthusiasm
ran high in New Orleans when their guest
said, as he had already announced in Tennessee,
that he intended to devote his life to overthrowing
all Spanish rule in America.</p>

<p>Day after day the soldier of fortune was busy
with his plans. When he started north on horseback
he carried with him the fame of a great patriot.
Wherever he stopped, at cabins, at villages, or cities,
the frontiersmen wanted to shake his hand. He rode
four hundred and fifty miles through the wilderness
from Natchez to Nashville, where he again visited Andrew
Jackson, who promised him Tennessee soldiers
for a war on Spain. At St. Louis he learned that
General Zebulon Pike was exploring the best route
over the plains to Santa Fé, and many letters told
him that the time was ripe to settle old grudges
with the borderers of Mexico. Everything seemed
favorable to his adventure. Burr had only to decide
where he would strike first. He was back in the
East by the middle of November, 1805, having
filled the whole country with rumors of wild plots
and insurrections. He was a figure of mystery.
People whispered that Aaron Burr was to be the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
Washington of a new republic in the West, or the
king of a country to be carved out of Mexico.</p>

<p>By the summer of 1806 Burr knew that he could
not get money from England to further his plans.
He would have to depend on his own countrymen in
any attack on Mexico or Spain. His journey had
showed him that many of them were eager to follow
his lead. Troubles were daily increasing along the
borders of Florida and Mexico. It looked easy to
take an army into Florida, but there would be more
profit in the rich country to the southwest. His
friend, General Wilkinson, had just been sent to
drive the Mexicans across the Sabine River, the
western boundary of Louisiana, and Burr thought
this was a good chance to go west again, and perhaps
call the settlers to arms. Men he trusted started
west early in the summer of 1806, and Burr, with his
daughter, and a Colonel De Pestre, who had fought
in the French Revolution, and a few friends and
servants, set out in August for their meeting-place
on Blennerhassett Island. When he arrived there
he was warmly welcomed by the owner. Burr
showed Blennerhassett how he could make his fortune
in Mexico, because if the conspiracy were successful
they could take a large part of that country
for themselves. Fired by Burr's story the men on
the island immediately began preparations. They
sent to the town of Marietta for one hundred barrels
of pork, and contracted to have fifteen boats delivered
at the island the following December. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
kiln was built near Blennerhassett's house for drying
corn, which was then ground into meal, and packed
for shipping. All sorts of provisions were purchased,
and the Blennerhassett family prepared to send their
household goods down the river. Word of the plans
spread, and men in various towns near the Ohio
made ready to join the expedition. When the
leader should send out his messengers recruits would
come pouring in.</p>

<p>In the meantime Burr himself had left the little
island and covered a wide stretch of country. He
wanted to be sure of Andrew Jackson's aid, and he
found that fiery warrior as ready as ever to fight
Spaniard or Mexican in the cause of liberty. The
general still thought that his friend Burr's only object
was to free all of North America. Eager in that
cause, Jackson sent word to the Tennessee militia,
urging them to be ready for instant duty against the
Spaniards, who, he said, had already captured several
citizens of the United States, had cut down our
flag, had driven our explorers away from the Red
River, and had taken an insulting position on the
east bank of the River Sabine, in the territory of
Orleans. He wrote to President Jefferson offering
to lead his Tennessee militia against the troops of
Spain. A large part of the country expected war at
once. Burr, for his own purposes, did all he could
to inflame this warlike feeling.</p>

<p>In October the chief conspirator met his daughter,
Theodosia Alston, her husband, and Blennerhassett<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
at Lexington, Kentucky. He now arranged to buy
a tract, known as the Bastrop lands, which included
nearly a million acres in northern Louisiana on the
Washita River. This purchase he meant to use as a
blind, intending to settle there only in case his other
plans failed. If the United States Government
should suspect the conspirators of plotting against
Mexico, they could pretend to be merely settlers,
armed to defend themselves in case the Spaniards
should overrun their borders. The tract would be
valuable in any case, because of the rich bottom-lands
and vast forests, and made a splendid base for
a raid into the Spanish provinces.</p>

<p>Recruits were added daily to Burr's forces. He
told them as much or as little of his schemes as he
thought advisable. To some he said that he was a
secret agent of the government, to others that he
only meant to start a new pioneer settlement. If
there should be war with Spain the men who followed
him would share in the spoils, if victorious. If there
was no war they would be ready to protect the
border against invaders.</p>

<p>There were some people, however, who could not
get over their distrust of Burr because of what he
had done. The mysterious preparations at Blennerhassett
Island caused some uneasiness in the neighborhood,
and on October 6th a mass meeting of the
people of Wood County, Virginia, was held, and
the military preparations on the island were denounced.
Blennerhassett was away at the time, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
his wife, hearing of the meeting, grew uneasy, and
sent her gardener, Peter Taylor, to tell her husband
this news. Taylor found the conspirators at Lexington,
and gave them Mrs. Blennerhassett's message.
The gardener was evidently taken into his master's
confidence, because he said later that the plan was
"to take Mexico, one of the finest and richest places
in the whole world." He added, "Colonel Burr
would be the King of Mexico, and Mrs. Alston,
daughter of Colonel Burr, was to be Queen of Mexico,
whenever Colonel Burr died.... Colonel Burr
had made fortunes for many in his time, but none
for himself; but now he was going to make something
for himself. He said that he had a great many
friends in the Spanish territory; no less than two
thousand Roman Catholic priests were engaged, and
all their friends would join, if once he could get to
them; that the Spaniards, like the French, had got
dissatisfied with their government, and wanted to
swap it."</p>

<p>President Jefferson could no longer overlook the
adventures of Burr and his friends. He knew that
very little was needed to kindle the flame of war on
the Mexican border. But he had his hands full with
foreign affairs; England was making trouble for
American sailors, and Napoleon was setting the
whole world by the ears. So the busy President
wrote to his agents in the West and urged them to
keep a secret watch over Colonel Burr and Blennerhassett
Island.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
War with Spain almost came that summer. There
were many disputed boundary lines between the
United States and the Spanish colonies. The Spanish
troops in Florida, Texas, and Mexico were prepared
for an attack from the United States, and
Spanish agents were urging Indian tribes to rise
against the white men. Men protested in Western
cities and towns. The people of Orleans Territory
were afraid that Spain was going to try to
win back their country by force of arms. On the
4th of July, 1806, the people of New Orleans held a
great patriotic celebration, and in the evening a play
called, "Washington; or the Liberty of the New
World," was acted to a huge audience. Even the
Creoles, who were more Spanish than Anglo-Saxon,
were eager to fight against the old tyranny of Spain.</p>

<p>In the midst of this war excitement word came
that a man born in Venezuela, named Francesco
Miranda, had sailed from New York to free his
native country from Spanish rule. Miranda was
looked upon as a hero and patriot by many people
in the United States, and this encouraged Burr and
his friends.</p>

<p>There were in 1806 about one thousand soldiers
in Texas, which was then a province of Mexico.
These troops were ordered to cross the Sabine
River, which formed a part of the disputed boundary,
and as soon as they did cross the governor of
Louisiana called for volunteers, and the people of
Mississippi Territory prepared to march to the aid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
of New Orleans. The meeting place of the volunteers
was Natchitoches, and there hundreds of countrymen
came flocking, armed, and eager to defend
Louisiana. Everything seemed ready for Aaron
Burr to launch his great adventure. But at this
point Burr's former friend, General James Wilkinson,
the governor of Louisiana, changed his mind as to
the wisdom of Burr's schemes. He would not give
the order to the volunteers to march to the Mexican
border, but waited, hoping that President Jefferson
would prevent the war by diplomacy, or that the
Spanish troops would decide to retreat.</p>

<p>On September 27th a great crowd in Nashville
hailed Colonel Burr as the deliverer of the Southwest,
and Andrew Jackson proclaimed, "Millions
for defense; not one cent for tribute;" and at the
same time the Mexican General Herrera ordered his
troops to retreat from the River Sabine. Danger of
war was over, and the moment the flag of Spain left
the Louisiana shore, Burr's dream of an empire for
himself and his friends vanished.</p>

<p>General Wilkinson knew that the government in
Washington was suspicious of Aaron Burr's plans,
and he thought that his name was included among
those of Burr's friends. Some newspapers had even
linked their names together, and the general, knowing
perhaps the treachery of his own thoughts, now
decided to prove his patriotism by accusing Aaron
Burr and the others of treason. All the time that he
was making a treaty with the Mexican general on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
the Texan frontier he was also working up a strong
case against Burr. He saw to it that the agents put
all suspicion on the shoulders of the others, and
made him appear as the one man who had tried his
best to protect his country. He intended to show
that not only was he not a traitor, but that he was
able to unmask traitors, by having pretended to join
with them earlier.</p>

<p>In his sudden eagerness to prevent war with the
Mexicans, General Wilkinson made terms of peace
with them, which proved a great disadvantage to
the United States at a later date, but which pleased
the peace party of the day. He met the Mexican
general at the very time when Burr and his allies
were ready to launch their fleet of boats on the
Mississippi River. Then Wilkinson made haste to
raise the cry of "Treason in the West," which was
to echo through the United States for months, and
ruin the reputation of many men.</p>

<p>President Jefferson trusted Wilkinson, and when
he heard the latter's charges against Burr he sent a
special messenger to see what was happening at
Blennerhassett Island. Before the messenger reached
the Alleghany Mountains, however, another man had
accused Burr in the court at Frankfort, Kentucky,
of having broken the laws of the country in starting
an expedition against Mexico. Burr said that he
could easily answer these charges, and sent a message
to Blennerhassett, telling him not to be disturbed.
He went to the court at Frankfort, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
when the man who had accused him could not
bring his witnesses the matter was promptly dropped.
Burr was more a hero than ever to the people of
Frankfort. They agreed with a leading newspaper
that said, "Colonel Burr has throughout this business
conducted himself with the calmness, moderation,
and firmness which have characterized him
through life. He evinced an earnest desire for a
full and speedy investigation&mdash;free from irritation or
emotion; he excited the strongest sensation of respect
and friendship in the breast of every impartial
person present."</p>

<p>Burr then went back to Lexington, and continued
raising money to buy a fleet of boats. Andrew
Jackson had already received three thousand dollars
in Kentucky for this purpose. Blennerhassett went
on enrolling volunteers. It looked as if Burr's conduct
at Frankfort had put an end to the rumors of
treason.</p>

<p>General Wilkinson, however, was still anxious to
make a name for himself as a great patriot, and he
kept sending alarming messages to Washington.
He accused his former friend of all sorts of treason.
It was also perfectly clear that a large number of
boats were being gathered on the Ohio under orders
of Burr and his friends, and so President Jefferson
sent word to the officers at Marietta to post one
hundred and fifty or two hundred soldiers on the
river to prevent Burr's fleet sailing. With the news
of this order people in the West began to suspect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
their former hero, and even some of his old allies
grew doubtful of his patriotism.</p>

<p>Wilkinson increased the alarm by orders he gave
in New Orleans as governor of Louisiana Territory.
He began to make military arrests, locking up all
those he distrusted, and all those who were admirers
of Aaron Burr. He had gunboats stationed in the
river, and they were ordered to fire on Burr's fleet if
it ever got that far, and he refused to allow any boats
to ascend the Mississippi without his express permission.
All this preparation caused great excitement
in New Orleans, which spread through the
neighboring country. It seemed as if General
Wilkinson were trying to force the people to believe
there was some great conspiracy on foot.</p>

<p>The colonel and his allies tried to explain that
their fleet of boats was simply to carry settlers, arms
and provisions into the Bastrop tract of land that
they had bought; but by now nobody would believe
them. On December 9, 1806, the boats that Blennerhassett
had been gathering on the Muskingum River
were seized by order of the governor of Ohio.
Patrols were placed along the Ohio River, and the
militia called out to capture Blennerhassett and the
men with him. The next day the Virginia militia
declared that they meant to find out the secret of
Blennerhassett Island. The owner and his friend,
Comfort Tyler, had word of this, and at once prepared
for flight. At midnight they left the island
and started down the Ohio by boat. The Virginia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
troops arrived to find the place deserted, and, leaving
sentinels there, started in pursuit of Blennerhassett.
The next day the sentries captured a flatboat with
fourteen boys on board, who were coming from
Pittsburgh to join Burr. People along the Ohio
began to expect attacks from Burr's recruits.
Cincinnati was especially alarmed. One of the newspapers
there stated that three of Burr's armed boats
were anchored near the city, which they meant to
attack. That night some practical joker exploded a
bomb, and the people thought that Burr's army was
firing on them. The citizens armed, and the militia
was called out, but when they came to inspect the
boats on the river next day they found that those
they thought belonged to Burr were vessels of a
Louisville merchant loaded with dry-goods. No
story was now too wild to be believed when it was
attached to the name of Burr or Blennerhassett.</p>

<p>Burr now only intended to sail down to his own
lands. On December 20th he sent word to Blennerhassett
that he would be at the mouth of the Cumberland
River on the twenty-third. Two days later he
put a number of horses on one of his boats, and with
a few men to help him, floated down the Cumberland
River to its mouth, where Blennerhassett and
the rest of their party were waiting for him. They
joined their seven boats to his two vessels, and had
a fleet of nine ships with about sixty men on board.
On December 28th they sailed down the Ohio, and
the next night anchored a little below Fort Massac.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
Country people along the river saw the flotilla
pass, and sent word of it to the nearest military post.
The captain there stopped all ships, but found nothing
suspicious on any of them. "Colonel Burr, late
Vice-President," the officer reported, "passed this
way with about ten boats of different descriptions,
navigated with about six men each, having nothing
on board that would even suffer a conjecture more
than that he was a man bound to market. He has
descended the river toward Orleans."</p>

<p>On the last day of 1806 the fleet reached the broad
waters of the Mississippi River. Four days later
they dropped anchor at Chickasaw Bluffs, now the
city of Memphis. Again officers boarded the boats,
and after examining the cargoes allowed them to go
on their voyage. On January 10th they reached
Mississippi Territory, and here they found the excitement
intense.</p>

<p>The fleet was now in territory that was under the
charge of General Wilkinson, and he immediately
sent three hundred and seventy-five soldiers from
Natchez to prevent Burr's further progress. On
January 16th two officers rowed out to the boats,
and were received pleasantly by Colonel Burr, who
laughed at General Wilkinson's suspicions, and,
pointing to his peaceful flotilla, asked if it looked as
if it were meant for war? When he was told that
the soldiers had orders to stop him, he answered that
he was willing to appear in court at any time. This
satisfied the two officers, who asked him to ride next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
day to the town of Washington, which was the
capital of Mississippi Territory, and appear before
the court there. Burr agreed, and early next morning
rode to Washington with the two officers who
had called on him. There he was charged with
having conspired against the United States government.
His friends on the river remained on their
boats, waiting for his return. The expedition never
went any farther.</p>

<p>Burr promised to stay in the Territory until the
charges against him were cleared up. His charm
of manner won him many friends, and people would
not believe him a traitor. When the grand jury
met they decided that Aaron Burr was not guilty of
treason. The judge, however, would not set him
free, and Burr realized that General Wilkinson was
using all his power against him. He thought that
his only chance of safety lay in defying the court,
and taking the advice of some friends fled to a
hiding-place near the home of Colonel Osmun, an
old acquaintance. He meant to leave that part of
the country, but the severe weather blocked his plans.
Heavy rains had swollen all the streams, and he
had to change his route. He set out with one companion,
but had to ask a farmer the road to the
house of Colonel Hinson. The farmer suspected
that one of the horsemen was Aaron Burr, and knew
that a large reward had been offered for his capture.
He carried his news to the sheriff, and then to the
officers at Fort Stoddert. A lieutenant from the fort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
with four soldiers joined the farmer, and, mounting
fast horses, they rode after the two men. Early the
next morning they came up with them. The lieutenant
demanded in the name of the government of
the United States whether one of the horsemen was
Colonel Burr. Aaron Burr admitted his name, and
was put under arrest. He was taken to the fort, and
held there as a fugitive from justice.</p>

<p>The cry of "Treason in the West" had been
heard all over the country. The great expedition
against Mexico had dwindled to a small voyage to
settle certain timber-lands. The formidable fleet was
only nine ordinary river boats. The army of rebels
had shrunk to less than sixty peaceful citizens;
and the store of arms and ammunition had been
reduced to a few rifles and powder-horns. Moreover
Aaron Burr had neither attempted to fight nor
to resist arrest. He had merely fled when he
thought he stood little chance of a fair trial. Yet
the cry of treason had so alarmed the country that
the government found it necessary to try the man
who had so nearly defeated Jefferson for the
Presidency.</p>

<p>Orders were sent to bring Aaron Burr east. After
a journey that lasted twenty-one days the prisoner
was lodged in the Eagle Tavern in Richmond,
Virginia. Here Chief-Justice Marshall examined the
charges against Burr, and held him in bail to appear
at the next term of court. The bail was secured,
and on the afternoon of April 1st Burr was once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
more set at liberty. From then until the day of the
trial interest in the case grew. Everywhere people
discussed the question whether Aaron Burr had been
a traitor to his country. By the time for the hearing
of the case feeling against him ran high. When
court met on May 22, 1807, Richmond was crowded
with many of the most prominent men of the time,
drawn by the charges against a man who had so lately
been Vice-President.</p>

<p>It was not until the following August that Colonel
Burr was actually put on trial. The question was
simply whether he had planned to make war against
the United States. There were many witnesses, led
by the faithless General Wilkinson, who were ready
to declare that the purpose of the meetings at
Blennerhassett Island was to organize an army to
divide the western country from the rest of the
republic. Each side was represented by famous
lawyers; and the battle was hard fought. In the
end, however, the jury found that Aaron Burr was
not guilty of treason. No matter what Burr and
Blennerhassett and their friends had planned to do
in Mexico, the jury could not believe they had been
so mad as to plot a war against the United States.</p>

<p>Burr, although now free, was really a man without
a country. He went to England and France, and in
both countries engaged in plans for freeing the
colonies of Spain. But both in England and in
France the people looked upon him with suspicion,
remembering his strange history. At the end of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
four years he returned to the United States. Here
he found that some of his early plans were coming
to fulfilment. Revolts were breaking out in Florida,
in Mexico, and in some of the West Indies. He was
allowed no part in any of these uprisings. Florida
became a part of the United States, and in time Burr
saw the men of Texas begin a struggle for freedom
from Mexico. When he read the news of this, he
exclaimed, "There! You see! I was right! I was
only thirty years too soon. What was treason in me
thirty years ago is patriotism now!" Later he was
asked whether he had really planned to divide the
Union when he started on his voyage from Blennerhassett
Island. He answered, "No; I would as soon
have thought of taking possession of the moon, and
informing my friends that I intended to divide it
among them."</p>

<p>Such is the story of Aaron Burr, a real soldier of
fortune, who wanted to carve out a new country for
himself, and came to be "a man without a country."</p>

<br />
<span class="larger">HOW THE YOUNG REPUBLIC FOUGHT THE BARBARY PIRATES</span></h2>

<h3 class="p2">I</h3>

<p>Long after pirates had been swept from the Western
Ocean they flourished in the Mediterranean Sea.
They hailed from the northern coast of Africa, where
between the Mediterranean and the desert of Sahara
stretched what were known as the Barbary States.
These states were Morocco, Algeria, Tunis, Tripoli,
and the tiny state of Barca, which was usually included
in Tripoli. Algeria, or, as it was commonly
called from the name of its capital, Algiers, was the
home of most of the Mediterranean pirates.</p>

<p>There was hardly a port in the whole of that inland
sea that had not seen a fleet of the pirates' boats
sweep down upon some innocent merchant vessel,
board her, overpower the crew, and carry them off to
be sold in the African slave-markets. Their ships were
usually square-rigged sailing vessels, which were
commonly called galleons. The pirates did not trust
to cannon, and the peculiar shape of the ships gave
them a good chance for hand-to-hand fighting. The
dark-skinned crew would climb out on the long
lateen yards that hung over their enemies' deck, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
drop from the yards and from the rigging, their
sabers held between their teeth, their loaded pistols
stuck in their belts, so that they might have free use
of their hands for climbing and clinging to ropes and
gunwales.</p>

<p>Strange as it seems, the great countries of Europe
made no real effort to destroy these pirates of the
Barbary coast, but instead actually paid them bribes
in order to protect their crews. The larger countries
thought that, as they could afford to pay the
tribute that the pirates demanded, and their smaller
rivals could not, the pirates might actually serve
them by annoying other countries. So England and
France, and the other big nations of Europe, put up
with all sorts of insults at the hands of these Moorish
buccaneers, and many times their consuls were ill-treated
and their sailors made to work in slave-gangs
because they had not paid as much tribute as the
Moors demanded.</p>

<p>Many an American skipper fell into the hands of
these corsairs. The brig <i class="ship">Polly</i> of Newburyport,
Massachusetts, was heading for the Spanish port of
Cadiz in October, 1793, when she was overhauled by
a brig flying the English flag. As the brig came
near her captain hailed the <i class="ship">Polly</i> in English, asking
where she was bound. Meanwhile the brig ran close
in beside the <i class="ship">Polly</i>, and the Americans saw a large
number of men, Moors by the look of their beards
and dress, spring up from under the rail. This crew
launched a big boat, and nearly one hundred men,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
armed with swords, pistols, spears, and knives, were
rowed up to the <i class="ship">Polly</i>. The Moors sprang on board.
The Yankees were greatly outnumbered, and were
driven into the cabin, while the pirates broke open
all the trunks and chests, and stripped the brig of
everything that could be moved. The prisoners
were then rowed to the Moorish ship, which sailed
for Algiers. There they were landed and marched
to the palace of the Dey, or ruler of Algiers, while
the people clapped their hands, shouted, and gave
thanks for the capture of so many "Christian dogs."
They were put in prison, where they found other
Americans, and nearly six hundred Christians of
other countries, all of whom were treated as slaves.
On the next day each captive was loaded with chains,
fastened around his waist and joined to a ring about
his ankle. They were then set to work in rigging
and fitting out ships, in blasting rocks in the mountains,
or carrying stones for the palace the Dey was
building. Their lot was but little better than that of
the slaves of olden times who worked for the
Pharaohs. As more American sailors were captured
and made slaves their friends at home grew more
and more eager to put an end to these pirates, and
when the Revolution was over the young Republic
of the United States began to heed the appeals for
help that came from the slave-markets along the
Barbary coast.</p>

<p>The Republic found, however, that so long as
England and France were paying tribute to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
pirates it would be easier for her to do the same
thing than to fight them. The American Navy was
very small, and the Mediterranean was far distant.
England seemed actually to be encouraging the
pirates, thinking that their attacks on American
ships would injure the country that had lately won
its independence. So the United States made the
best terms it could with the rulers of Algiers,
Morocco, Tunis, and Tripoli, and paid heavy ransoms
for the release of the captives. There was little self-respect
or honor among the Moorish chiefs, however.
One Dey succeeded another, each more
greedy than the last, and each demanded more
tribute money or threatened to seize all the Americans
he could lay hands upon. The consuls had
to be constantly making presents in order to keep
the Moors in a good humor, and whenever the Dey
felt the need of more money he would demand it of
the United States consul, and threaten to throw him
in prison if he refused.</p>

<p>This state of affairs was very unpleasant for free
men, but for a number of years it had to be put up
with. When Captain Bainbridge dropped anchor off
Algiers in command of the United States frigate
<i class="ship">George Washington</i>, the Dey demanded that he
should carry a Moorish envoy to Constantinople
with presents for the Sultan of Turkey. Bainbridge
did not like to be treated as a messenger boy; but
the Dey said, "You pay me tribute, by which you
become my slaves. I have, therefore, a right to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
order you as I may think proper." Bainbridge had
no choice but to obey the command, or leave American
merchant vessels at the mercy of the Moors, and
so he carried the Dey's presents to the Sultan.</p>

<p>As all the Barbary States throve on war, in that
way gaining support from the enemies of the country
they attacked, one or the other was constantly
making war. In May, 1801, the Pasha of Tripoli declared
war against the United States, cut down the
American flagstaff at his capital, and sent out his
pirate ships. In reply the United States ordered a
squadron of four vessels under command of Commodore
Richard Dale to sail to the Mediterranean.
This squadron did good service, capturing a number
of the galleys of Tripoli, and exchanging Moorish
prisoners for American slaves. But the pirates were
like a swarm of hornets; they stung wherever they
got a chance, and as soon as the war-ships were out
of sight they would steal out from their hiding-places
to terrorize the coast. The United States had to
keep sending squadrons to act as policemen. When
the fleet kept together the Moors had proper respect
for them, but once the ships separated they became
the target for the hornets.</p>

<p>The frigate <i class="ship">Philadelphia</i>, of thirty-six guns, was
detailed in October, 1803, to blockade the port of
Tripoli. The morning after she reached there she
saw a ship inshore preparing to sail westward. The
frigate gave chase, and as the other vessel carried
the colors of Tripoli, the frigate opened fire. As she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
chased the Moor the <i class="ship">Philadelphia</i> ran on a shelving
rock that was part of a long reef. Her crew worked
hard to get her off, but she stuck fast. As the Moors
on shore saw the plight of the <i class="ship">Philadelphia</i> they
manned their boats, and soon she was surrounded
by a swarm of pirate galleys. The galleys sailed
under the fire of the frigate's heavy guns, and came
up to close quarters, where the cannon could not
reach them. The Americans were helpless, and by
sunset Commodore Bainbridge had to strike his flag.
As soon as he surrendered the Moors swarmed over
the sides of his ship, broke everything they could
lay their hands on, stripped officers and men of their
uniforms, and tumbled them into the small boats.
The prisoners were landed at night, and led to the
castle gate. The sailors were treated as slaves, but
the officers were received by the Pasha in the great
marble-paved hall of his palace, where that ruler,
dressed in silks and jewels, and surrounded by a
gorgeous court, asked them many questions, and
later offered them supper. But the favor of the
Pasha was as fickle as the wind; within a day or two
he was treating the American officers much as he
treated his other Christian captives, and the crew,
three hundred and seven in number, were worked as
slaves. Meantime the Moors, using anchors and
cables, succeeded in pulling the <i class="ship">Philadelphia</i> off the
reef, and the frigate was pumped out and made seaworthy.
She was brought into the harbor, to the
delight of the Pasha and his people at owning so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
fine a war-ship. The loss of the <i class="ship">Philadelphia</i> was a
severe blow, not only to American pride, but to
American fortunes. The squadron was now much
too small for service, and Bainbridge and his crew
were hostages the United States must redeem.</p>

<p>It fell to the lot of Commodore Preble to take
charge of the American ships in the Mediterranean,
and he began to discuss terms of peace with Tripoli
through an agent of the Pasha at Malta. By these
terms the frigate <i class="ship">Philadelphia</i> was to be exchanged
for a schooner, and the Moorish prisoners in Preble's
hands, sixty in number, were to be exchanged for as
many of the American prisoners in Tripoli, and the
rest of the American captives were to be ransomed
at five hundred dollars a man. Before these terms
were agreed upon, however, a more daring plan occurred
to the American commodore, and on February
3, 1804, he entrusted a delicate task to Stephen
Decatur, who commanded the schooner <i class="ship">Enterprise</i>.
Decatur picked a volunteer crew, put them on board
the ships <i class="ship">Siren</i> and <i class="ship">Intrepid</i>, and sailed for Tripoli.
They reached that port on February 7th, and to
avoid suspicion the <i class="ship">Intrepid</i> drew away from the
other ship and anchored after dark about a mile
west of the town. A small boat with a pilot and
midshipman was sent in to reconnoiter the harbor.
They reported that the sea was breaking across the
western entrance, and as the weather was threatening
advised Decatur not to try to enter that night.
The two American ships therefore stood offshore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
and were driven far to the east by a gale. The
weather was so bad that it was not until February
16th that they returned to Tripoli. This time the
<i class="ship">Intrepid</i> sailed slowly toward the town, while the
<i class="ship">Siren</i>, disguised as a merchantman, kept some distance
in the rear.</p>

<p>The frigate <i class="ship">Philadelphia</i>, now the Pasha's prize
ship, lay at anchor in the harbor, and the <i class="ship">Intrepid</i>
slowly drifted toward her in the light of the new
moon. No one on ship or shore realized the real
purpose of the slowly-moving <i class="ship">Intrepid</i>. Had the
men at the forts on shore or the watchman at the
Pasha's castle suspected her purpose they could have
blown her from the water with their heavy guns.</p>

<p>The <i class="ship">Intrepid</i> drifted closer and closer, with her
crew hidden, except for six or eight men dressed as
Maltese sailors. Decatur stood by the pilot at the
helm. When the little ship was about one hundred
yards from the <i class="ship">Philadelphia</i> she was hailed and ordered
to keep away. The pilot answered that his
boat had lost her anchor in the storm, and asked
permission to make fast to the frigate for the night.
This was given, and the Moorish officer on the
<i class="ship">Philadelphia</i> asked what the ship in the distance was.
The pilot said that she was the <i class="ship">Transfer</i>, a vessel
lately purchased at Malta by the Moors, which was
expected at Tripoli about that time. The pilot kept
on talking in order to lull the Moors' suspicions, and
meantime the little <i class="ship">Intrepid</i> came close under the
port bow of the <i class="ship">Philadelphia</i>. Just then the wind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
shifted and held the schooner away from the frigate,
and directly in range of her guns. Again the Moors
had a chance to destroy the American boat and crew
if they had known her real object. They did not
suspect it, however. Each ship sent out a small
boat with a rope, and when the ropes were joined
the two ships were drawn close together.</p>

<p>When the vessels were almost touching some one
on the <i class="ship">Philadelphia</i> suddenly shouted, "Americanos!"
At the same moment Decatur gave the
order "Board!" and the American crew sprang
over the side of the frigate and jumped to her deck.
The Moors were huddled on the forecastle. Decatur
formed his men in line and charged. The surprised
Moors made little resistance, and Decatur quickly
cleared the deck of them; some jumped into the
sea, and others escaped in a large boat. The Americans
saw that they could not get the <i class="ship">Philadelphia</i>
safely out of the harbor, and so quickly brought
combustibles from the <i class="ship">Intrepid</i>, and stowing them
about the <i class="ship">Philadelphia</i>, set her on fire. In a very
few minutes she was in flames, and the Americans
jumped from her deck to their own ship. It took
less than twenty minutes to capture and fire the
<i class="ship">Philadelphia</i>.</p>

<p>Decatur ordered his men to the oars, and the
<i class="ship">Intrepid</i> beat a retreat from the harbor. But now
the town of Tripoli was fully aroused. The forts
opened fire on the little schooner. A ship commanded
the channel through which she had to sail,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
but fortunately for the <i class="ship">Intrepid</i> the Moors' aim was
poor, and the only shot that struck her was one
through the topgallantsail. The harbor was
brightly lighted now. The flames had run up the
mast and rigging of the <i class="ship">Philadelphia</i>, and as they
reached the powder loud explosions echoed over the
sea. Presently the cables of the frigate burned, and
the <i class="ship">Philadelphia</i> drifted ashore and blew up. In the
meantime the <i class="ship">Intrepid</i> reached the entrance safely,
and joining the <i class="ship">Siren</i> set sail for Syracuse.</p>

<p>The blowing up of the <i class="ship">Philadelphia</i> was one
of the most daring acts ever attempted by the
United States Navy, and won Decatur great credit.
It weakened the Pasha's strength, and kept his
pirate crews in check. Instead of making terms
with the Moorish ruler, the United States decided
to attack his capital, and in the summer of 1804,
Commodore Preble collected his squadron before
Tripoli. On August 3d the fleet approached the
land batteries, and in the afternoon began to throw
shells into the town. The Moors immediately opened
fire, both from the forts and from their fleet of
nineteen gunboats and two galleys that lay in the
harbor. Preble divided his ships, and ordered them
to close in on the enemy's vessels, although the
latter outnumbered them three to one. Again
Decatur was the hero of the fight. He and his
men boarded a Moorish gunboat and fought her
crew hand-to-hand across the decks. He captured
the first vessel, and then boarded a second. Decatur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
singled out the captain, a gigantic Moor, and
made for him. The Moor thrust at him with a pike,
and Decatur's cutlass was broken off at the hilt.
Another thrust of the pike cut his arm, but the
American seized the weapon, tore it away, and
threw himself on the Moor. The crews were fighting
all around their leaders, and a Moorish sailor
aimed a blow at Decatur's head with a scimitar.
An American seaman struck the blow aside, and the
scimitar gashed his own scalp. The Moorish captain,
stronger than Decatur, got him underneath, and
drawing a knife, was about to kill him, when Decatur
caught the Moor's arm with one hand, thrust
his other hand into his pocket, and fired his revolver.
The Moor was killed, and Decatur sprang
to his feet. Soon after the enemy's crew surrendered.
The other United States ships had been
almost as successful, and the battle taught the
Americans that the Barbary pirates could be beaten
in hand-to-hand fighting as well as at long range.</p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Decatur Caught the Moor's Arm</span>
</div></div>

<p>The Pasha was not ready to come to terms even
after that day's defeat, however, and on August 7th
Commodore Preble ordered another attack. Again
the harbor shook under the guns of the fleet and
the forts, and at sunset Preble had to withdraw. To
avoid further bloodshed the commodore sent a flag
of truce to the Pasha, and offered to pay eighty
thousand dollars for the ransom of the American
prisoners, and to make him a present of ten thousand
dollars more. The Pasha, however, demanded one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
hundred and fifty thousand dollars, and Preble was
not willing to pay that amount. So later in August
he attacked Tripoli again. Each of these bombardments
did great damage to the city, but the forts
were too strong to be captured. The blockading
fleet, however, held its position, and on September
3d opened fire again in the last of its assaults.
In spite of the heavy firing the Pasha refused to
pull down his flag.</p>

<p>On the night of September 4th a volunteer crew
took the little <i class="ship">Intrepid</i> into the harbor. She was
filled with combustibles, and when she was close to
the Moorish ships the powder was to be fired by a
fuse that would give time for the crew to escape in a
small boat. The night was dark, and the fleet soon
lost sight of this fire-ship. She took the right
course through the channel, but before she was
near the Moors she was seen and they opened fire
on her. Then came a loud explosion, and the
<i class="ship">Intrepid</i>, with her crew, was blown into the air.
No one knows whether one of the enemy's shots or
her own crew fired the powder. This was the greatest
disaster that befell the United States Navy during
all its warfare with the Barbary pirates. Soon after
Commodore Preble sailed for home, though most of
his fleet were kept in the Mediterranean to protect
American sailing vessels.</p>

<p>The government at Washington, tired with the
long warfare in the Mediterranean, soon afterward
ordered the consul at Algiers, Tobias Lear, to treat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
for peace with the Pasha. A bargain was finally
struck. One hundred Moors were exchanged for as
many of the American captives, and sixty thousand
dollars were paid as ransom for the rest. June 4,
1805, the American sailors, who had been slaves
for more than nineteen months, were released from
their chains and sent on board the war-ship <i class="ship">Constitution</i>.
The Pasha declared himself a friend of the
United States, and saluted its flag with twenty-one
guns from his castle and forts.</p>

<p>In the Barbary States rulers followed one another
in rapid succession. He who was Dey or Pasha one
week might be murdered by an enemy the next, and
that enemy on mounting the throne was always
eager to get as much plunder as he could. Treaties
meant little to any of them, and so other countries
kept on paying them tribute for the sake of peace.</p>

<p>The United States fell into the habit of buying
peace with Algiers, Tripoli, Morocco, and Tunis by
gifts of merchandise or gold or costly vessels. But
the more that was given to them the more greedy
these Moorish rulers grew, and so it happened that
from time to time they sent out their pirates to board
American ships in order to frighten the young Republic
into paying heavier tribute. Seven years
later the second chapter of our history with the Barbary
pirates opened.</p>

<h3 class="p2">II</h3>

<p>The brig <i class="ship">Edwin</i> of Salem, Massachusetts, was
sailing under full canvas through the Mediterranean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
Sea, bound out from Malta to Gibraltar, on August 25,
1812. At her masthead she flew the Stars and Stripes.
The weather was favoring, the little brig making
good speed, and the Mediterranean offered no dangers
to the skipper. Yet Captain George Smith,
and his crew of ten Yankee sailors, kept constantly
looking toward the south at some distant sails that
had been steadily gaining on them since dawn.
Every stitch of sail on the <i class="ship">Edwin</i> had been set, but
she was being overhauled, and at this rate would be
caught long before she could reach Gibraltar.</p>

<p>Captain Smith and his men knew who manned
those long, low, rakish-looking frigates. But the
<i class="ship">Edwin</i> carried no cannon, and if they could not out-sail
the three ships to the south they must yield
peaceably, or be shot down on their deck. Hour after
hour they watched, and by sunset they could see
the dark, swarthy faces of the leading frigate's crew.
Before night the <i class="ship">Edwin</i> had been overhauled,
boarded, and the Yankee captain and sailors were in
irons, prisoners about to be sold into slavery.</p>

<p>They had been captured by one of the pirate crews
of the Dey of Algiers, and when they were taken
ashore by these buccaneers they were stood up in
the slave market and sold to Moors, or put to work
in the shipyards. Other Yankee crews had met
with the same treatment.</p>

<p>Now the United States had been paying its tribute
regularly to the pirates, but in the spring of 1812 the
Dey of Algiers suddenly woke up to the fact that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
Americans had been measuring time by the sun
while the Moors figured it by the moon, and found
that in consequence he had been defrauded of almost
a half-year's tribute money, or twenty-seven thousand
dollars. He sent an indignant message to Tobias
Lear, the American consul at Algiers, threatening
all sorts of punishments, and Mr. Lear, taking
all things into account, decided it was best to pay the
sum claimed by the Dey. The United States sent
the extra tribute in the shape of merchandise by the
sailing vessel <i class="ship">Alleghany</i>; but the Dey was now in a
very bad temper, and declared that the stores were
of poor quality, and ordered the consul to leave at
once in the <i class="ship">Alleghany</i>, as he would have no further
dealings with a country that tried to cheat him. At
almost the same time he received a present from
England of two large ships filled with stores of war,&mdash;powder,
shot, anchors, and cables. He immediately
sent out word to the buccaneers to capture all
the American ships they could, and sell the sailors
in the slave-markets. The Dey of Algiers appeared
to have no fear of the United States.</p>

<p>The truth of the matter was that his Highness
the Dey, and also the Bey of Tunis, had been spoiled
by England, who at this time told them confidently
that the United States Navy was about to be wiped
from the seas. English merchants assured them
that they could treat Captain Smith and other
Yankee skippers exactly as they pleased, since Great
Britain had declared war on the United States, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
the latter country would find herself quite busy at
home. Algiers and Tripoli and Tunis, remembering
their old grudge against the Americans, assured
their English friends that nothing would delight
them so much as to rid the Mediterranean of the
Stars and Stripes.</p>

<p>The pirates swept down on the brig <i class="ship">Edwin</i>, and
laid hands on every American they could find in the
neighborhood. They stopped and boarded a ship
flying the Spanish flag, and took prisoner a Mr.
Pollard, of Virginia. Tripoli and Tunis permitted
English cruisers to enter their harbors, contrary to
the rules of war, and recapture four English prizes
that had been sent to them by the American privateer
<i class="ship">Abellino</i>. When the United States offered to
pay a ransom of three thousand dollars for every
American who was held as a prisoner the Dey replied
that he meant to capture a large number of
them before he would consider any terms of sale.</p>

<p>Our country was young and poor, and our navy
consisted of only seventeen seaworthy ships, carrying
less than four hundred and fifty cannon. England
was indeed "Mistress of the Seas," with a
great war-fleet of a thousand vessels, armed with
almost twenty-eight thousand guns. No wonder
that the British consul at Algiers had told the Dey
"the American flag would be swept from the seas,
the contemptible navy of the United States annihilated,
and its maritime arsenals reduced to a heap of
ruins." No wonder the Dey believed him. But as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
a matter of fact the little David outfought the giant
Goliath; on the Great Lakes and on the high seas
the Stars and Stripes waved triumphant after many
a long and desperate encounter, and the small navy
came out of the War of 1812 with a glorious record
of victories, with splendid officers and crews, and
with sixty-four ships. The English friends of the
Barbary States had been mistaken, and Algiers,
Tunis, and Tripoli began to wish they had not been
so scornful of the Yankees.</p>

<p>It was time to show the pirates that Americans
had as much right to trade in the Mediterranean as
other people. On February 23, 1815, a few days
after the treaty of peace with England was published,
President Madison advised that we should
send a fleet to Algiers. Two squadrons were ordered
on this service, under command of Commodore
William Bainbridge. One collected at Boston, and
the other at New York. Commodore Stephen Decatur
was in charge of the latter division.</p>

<p>Decatur's squadron was the first to sail, leaving
New York on May 20, 1815. He had ten vessels in
all, his flag-ship being the forty-four-gun frigate
<i class="ship">Guerrière</i>, and his officers and crew being all seasoned
veterans of the war with England. The fleet
of the Dey of Algiers, however, was no mean foe.
It consisted of twelve vessels, well armed and
manned, six sloops, five frigates, and one schooner.
Its admiral was a very remarkable man, one of the
fierce tribe of Kabyles from the mountains, Reis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
Hammida by name, who had made himself the
scourge of the Mediterranean. He had plenty of
reckless courage; once he had boarded and captured
in broad daylight a Portuguese frigate under
the very cliffs of Gibraltar, and at another time,
being in command of three Algerine frigates, had
dared to attack a Portuguese ship of the line and
three frigates, in face of the guns leveled at him
from the Rock of Lisbon, directly opposite.</p>

<p>The city of Algiers itself was one of the best
fortified ports on the Mediterranean. It lay in the
form of a triangle, one side extending along the sea,
while the other two rose against a hill, meeting at
the top at the Casbah, the historic fortress of the
Deys. The city was guarded by very thick walls,
mounted with many guns, and the harbor, made by
a long mole, was commanded by heavy batteries, so
that at least five hundred pieces of cannon could be
brought to bear on any hostile ships trying to enter.</p>

<p>Decatur's fleet was only a few days out of New
York when it ran into a heavy gale, and the wooden
ships were badly tossed about. The <i class="ship">Firefly</i>, a
twelve-gun brig, sprung her masts, and had to put
back to port. The other ships rode out the storm,
and kept on their course to the Azores, keeping a
sharp watch for any suspicious-looking craft. As
they neared the coast of Portugal the vigilance was
redoubled, for here was a favorite hunting-ground
of Reis Hammida, and Decatur knew what the
Algerine admiral had done before the Rock of Lisbon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
They found no trace of the enemy here, however.
At Cadiz Decatur sent a messenger to the
American consul, who informed him that three Algerine
frigates and some smaller ships had been
spoken in the Atlantic Ocean, but were thought to
have returned to the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>Decatur wanted to take the enemy by surprise,
and so sailed cautiously to Tangier, where he learned
that two days earlier Reis Hammida had gone
through the Straits of Gibraltar in the forty-six-gun
frigate <i class="ship">Mashuda</i>. The American captain at once
set sail for Gibraltar, and found out there that the
wily Algerine was lying off Cape Gata, having demanded
that Spain should pay him half a million
dollars of tribute money to protect her coast-towns
from attack by his fleet.</p>

<p>Lookouts on the <i class="ship">Guerrière</i> reported to Decatur
that a despatch-boat had left Gibraltar as soon as
the American ships appeared, and inquiry led the
captain to believe the boat was bearing messages to
Reis Hammida. Other boats were sailing for Algiers,
and Decatur, realizing the ease with which his
wily opponent, thoroughly familiar with the inland
sea, would be able to elude him, decided to give
chase at once.</p>

<p>The fleet headed up the Mediterranean June 15th,
under full sail. The next evening ships were seen
near shore, and Decatur ordered the frigate <i class="ship">Macedonian</i>
and two brigs to overhaul them. Early the
following morning, when the fleet was about twenty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
miles out from Cape Gata, Captain Gordon, of the
frigate <i class="ship">Constellation</i>, sighted a big vessel flying the
flag of Algiers, and signaled "An enemy to the
southeast."</p>

<p>Decatur saw that the strange ship had a good
start of his fleet, and was within thirty hours' run of
Algiers. He suspected that her captain might not
have detected the fleet as American, and ordered
the <i class="ship">Constellation</i> back to her position abeam of his
flag-ship, gave directions to try to conceal the identity
of his squadron, and stole up on the stranger. The
latter was seen to be a frigate, lying to under small
sail, as if waiting for some message from the African
shore near at hand. One of the commanders asked
permission to give chase, but Decatur signaled back
"Do nothing to excite suspicion."</p>

<p>The Moorish frigate held her position near shore
while the American ships drew closer. When they
were about a mile distant a quartermaster on the
<i class="ship">Constellation</i>, by mistake, hoisted a United States
flag. To cover this blunder the other ships were
immediately ordered to fly English flags. But the
crew of the Moorish frigate had seen the flag on the
<i class="ship">Constellation</i>, and instantly swarmed out on the
yard-arms, and had the sails set for flight. They
were splendid seamen, and almost immediately the
frigate was leaping under all her canvas for Algiers.
The Americans were busy too. The rigging of each
ship was filled with sailors, working out on the yards,
the decks rang with commands, and messages were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
signaled from the flag-ship to the captains. Decatur
crowded on all sail, fearing that the Algerine frigate
might escape him in the night or seek refuge in
some friendly harbor, and the American squadron
raced along at top speed, just as the Barbary pirates
had earlier chased after the little brig <i class="ship">Edwin</i>, of Salem.</p>

<p>Soon the <i class="ship">Constellation</i>, which was to the south of
the fleet and so nearest to the Moorish frigate,
opened fire and sent several shots on board the
enemy. The latter immediately came about, and
headed northeast, as if making for the port of Carthagena.
The Americans also tacked, and gained
by this man&oelig;uvre, the sloop <i class="ship">Ontario</i> cutting across
the Moor's course, and the <i class="ship">Guerrière</i> being brought
close enough for musketry fire.</p>

<p>As the flag-ship came to close quarters the Moors
opened fire, wounding several men, but Decatur
waited until his ship cleared the enemy's yard-arms,
when he ordered a broadside. The crew of the
Algerine frigate, which was the <i class="ship">Mashuda</i>, were
mowed down by this heavy fire. Reis Hammida
himself had already been wounded by one of the
first shots from the <i class="ship">Constellation</i>. He had, however,
insisted on continuing to give orders from a couch
on the quarter-deck, but a shot from the first broadside
killed him. The <i class="ship">Guerrière's</i> gun crews loaded
and fired again before the first smoke had cleared;
at this second broadside one of her largest guns exploded,
killing three men, wounding seventeen, and
splintering the spar-deck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
The Moors made no sign of surrender, but Decatur,
seeing that there were too few left to fight,
and not wishing to pour another broadside into
them, sailed past, and took a position just out of
range. The Algerines immediately tried to run before
him. In doing this the big <i class="ship">Mashuda</i> was
brought directly against the little eighteen-gun
American brig <i class="ship">Epervier</i>, commanded by John
Downes. Instead of sailing away Downes placed
his brig under the Moor's cabin ports, and by backing
and filling escaped colliding with the frigate
while he fired his small broadsides at her. This running
fire, lasting for twenty-five minutes, finished
the Moor's resistance, and the frigate surrendered.</p>

<p>The flag-ship, the <i class="ship">Guerrière</i>, now took charge of
the Algerine prize, and Decatur sent an officer, two
midshipmen, and a crew on board her. The <i class="ship">Mashuda</i>
was a sorry sight, many of her men killed or wounded,
and her decks splintered by the American broadsides.
The prisoners were transferred to the other ships,
and orders were given to the prize-crew to take the
captured frigate to the port of Carthagena, under
escort of the <i class="ship">Macedonian</i>.</p>

<p>Before this was done, however, Decatur signaled
all the officers to meet on his flag-ship. In the cabin
they found a table covered with captured Moorish
weapons,&mdash;daggers, pistols, scimitars, and yataghans.
Decatur turned to Commandant Downes, who had
handled the small <i class="ship">Epervier</i> so skilfully. "As you
were fortunate in obtaining a favorable position and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
maintained it so handsomely, you shall have the first
choice of these weapons," he said. Downes chose,
and then each of the other officers selected a trophy
of the victory. That evening the squadron, leaving
the <i class="ship">Mashuda</i> in charge of the <i class="ship">Macedonian</i>, resumed
its hunt for other ships belonging to the navy of the
piratical Dey.</p>

<p>The fleet was arriving off Cape Palos on June 19th
when a brig was seen, looking suspiciously like an
Algerine craft. When the Americans set sail toward
her, the stranger ran away. Soon she came to shoal
water, and the frigates had to leave the chase to the
light-draught <i class="ship">Epervier</i>, <i class="ship">Spark</i>, <i class="ship">Torch</i>, and <i class="ship">Spitfire</i>.
These followed and opened fire. The strange brig
returned several shots, and was then run aground
by her crew on the coast between the watch-towers
of Estacio and Albufera, which had been built long
before for the purpose of protecting fishermen and
peasants from the raids of pirates. The strangers
took to their small boats. One of these was sunk
by a shot. The Americans then boarded the ship,
which was the Algerine twenty-two-gun brig <i class="ship">Estedio</i>,
and captured eighty-three prisoners. The brig was
floated off the shoals and sent with a prize-crew into
the Spanish port of Carthagena.</p>

<p>Decatur, being unable to sight any more ships
that looked like Moorish craft, and supposing that
the rest of the pirate fleet would probably be making
for Algiers, gave commands to his squadron to
sail for that port. He was determined to bring the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
Dey to terms as quickly as possible, and to destroy
his fleet, or bombard the city, if that was necessary.
When he arrived off the Moorish town, however, he
found none of the fleet there, and no apparent preparation
for war in the harbor. The next morning he
ran up the Swedish flag at the mainmast, and a
white flag at the foremast, a signal asking the Swedish
consul to come on board the flag-ship. Mr.
Norderling, the consul, came out to the <i class="ship">Guerrière</i>,
accompanied by the Algerine captain of the port.
After some conversation Decatur asked the latter
for news of the Dey's fleet. "By this time it is safe
in some neutral port," was the assured answer.</p>

<p>"Not all of it," said Decatur, "for we have captured
the <i class="ship">Mashuda</i> and the <i class="ship">Estedio</i>."</p>

<p>The Algerine could not believe this, and told the
American so. Then Decatur sent for a wounded
lieutenant of the <i class="ship">Mashuda</i>, who was on his ship, and
bade him confirm the statement. The Moorish
officer of the port immediately changed his tactics,
dropped his haughty attitude, and gave Decatur to
understand that he thought the Dey would be willing
to make a new treaty of peace with the United
States.</p>

<p>Decatur handed the Moor a letter from the President
to the Dey, which stated that the Republic
would only agree to peace provided Algiers would
give up her claim to tribute and would cease molesting
American merchantmen.</p>

<p>The Moor wanted to gain as much time as possible,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
hoping his fleet would arrive, and said that it
was the custom to discuss all treaties in the palace on
shore. Decatur understood the slow and crafty
methods of these people, and answered that the
treaty should be drawn up and signed on board the
<i class="ship">Guerrière</i> or not at all. Seeing that there was no
use in arguing with the American the Moorish officer
went ashore to consult with the Dey.</p>

<p>Next day, June 30th, the captain of the port returned,
with power to act for his Highness Omar
Pasha. Decatur told him that he meant to put an
end to these piratical attacks on Americans, and insisted
that all his countrymen who were being held
as slaves in Algiers should be given up, that the
value of goods taken from them should be paid them,
that the Dey should give the owners of the brig
<i class="ship">Edwin</i> of Salem ten thousand dollars, that all Christians
who escaped from Algiers to American ships
should be free, and that the two nations should act
toward each other exactly as other civilized countries
did. Then the Moorish officer began to explain and
argue. He said that it was not the present ruling Dey,
Omar Pasha, called "Omar the Terrible" because
of his great courage, who had attacked American
ships; it was Hadji Ali, who was called the "Tiger"
because of his cruelty, but he had been assassinated
in March, and his prime minister, who succeeded
him, had been killed the following month, and Omar
Pasha was a friend of the United States. Decatur
replied that his terms for peace could not be altered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
The Moor then asked for a truce while he should
go ashore and confer with the Dey. Decatur said he
would grant no truce. The Algerine besought him
to make no attack for three hours. "Not a minute!"
answered Decatur. "If your squadron appears before
the treaty is actually signed by the Dey, and
before the American prisoners are sent aboard, I will
capture it!"</p>

<p>The Moorish captain said he would hurry at once
to the Dey, and added that if the Americans should
see his boat heading out to the <i class="ship">Guerrière</i> with a white
flag in the bow they would know that Omar Pasha
had agreed to Decatur's terms.</p>

<p>An hour later the Americans sighted an Algerine
war-ship coming from the east. Decatur signaled his
fleet to clear for action, and gave orders to his own
men on the <i class="ship">Guerrière</i>. The fleet had hardly weighed
anchor, however, before the small boat of the port
captain was seen dashing out from shore, a white
flag in the bow. The excited Moor waved to the
crew of the flag-ship. As soon as the boat was near
enough Decatur asked if the Dey had signed the
treaty, and set the American captives free. The
captain assured him of this, and a few minutes later
his boat was alongside the flag-ship, and the Americans,
who had been seized and held by the pirates,
were given over to their countrymen. Some of them
had been slaves for several years, and their delight
knew no bounds.</p>

<p>In so short a time did Decatur succeed in bringing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
the Dey to better terms than he had made with any
other country. When the treaty had been signed the
Dey's prime minister said to the English consul,
with reproach in his voice, "You told us that the
Americans would be swept from the seas in six
months by your navy, and now they make war upon
us with some of your own vessels which they have
taken." As a fact three of the ships in Decatur's
squadron had actually been won from the English in
the War of 1812.</p>

<p>The <i class="ship">Epervier</i>, commanded by Lieutenant John
Templer Shubrick, was now ordered to return to the
United States, with some of the Americans rescued
from Algiers. The fate of the brig is one of the
mysteries of the sea. She sailed through the Straits
of Gibraltar July 12, 1815, and was never heard of
again. She is supposed to have been lost in a heavy
storm in which a number of English merchantmen
foundered near the West Indies.</p>

<p>Algiers had now been brought to her knees by
Decatur, and he was free to turn to Tunis and
Tripoli. The rulers of each of these countries had
been misled by the English agents exactly as had the
Dey of Algiers, and the Bey of Tunis had allowed
the British cruiser <i class="ship">Lyra</i> to recapture some English
prizes that the American privateer <i class="ship">Abellino</i> had
taken into harbor during the War of 1812. Like
Algiers, both Tunis and Tripoli were well protected
by fleets and imposing forts. Decatur, however, had
now learned that downright and prompt measures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
were the ones most successful in dealing with the
Moors, who were used to long delays and arguments.
He anchored off Tunis on July 26th, and immediately
sent word to the Bey that the latter must pay the
United States forty-six thousand dollars for allowing
the English <i class="ship">Lyra</i> to seize the American prizes, and
that the money must be paid within twelve hours.</p>

<p>The United States consul, Mordecai M. Noah,
carried Decatur's message to the Bey. The Moorish
ruler was seated on a pile of cushions at a window of
his palace, combing his long, flowing black beard
with a tortoise-shell comb set with diamonds. Mr.
Noah politely stated Decatur's terms.</p>

<p>"Tell your admiral to come and see me," said the
Bey.</p>

<p>"He declines coming, your Highness," answered
the consul, "until these disputes are settled, which
are best done on board the ship."</p>

<p>The Bey frowned. "But this is not treating me
with becoming dignity. Hammuda Pasha, of blessed
memory, commanded them to land and wait at the
palace until he was pleased to receive them."</p>

<p>"Very likely, your Highness," said Mr. Noah,
"but that was twenty years ago."</p>

<p>The Bey considered. "I know this admiral," he
remarked at length; "he is the same one who, in the
war with Sidi Yusuf, burned the frigate." He referred
to Decatur's burning the <i class="ship">Philadelphia</i> in the
earlier warfare.</p>

<p>The consul nodded. "The same."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
"Hum!" said the Bey. "Why do they send wild
young men to treat for peace with old powers?
Then, you Americans do not speak the truth. You
went to war with England, a nation with a great
fleet, and said you took her frigates in equal fight.
Honest people always speak the truth."</p>

<p>"Well, sir, and that was true. Do you see that
tall ship in the bay flying a blue flag?" The consul
pointed through the window. "It is the
<i class="ship">Guerrière</i>, taken from the British. That one near
the small island, the <i class="ship">Macedonian</i>, was also captured
by Decatur on equal terms. The sloop near Cape
Carthage, the <i class="ship">Peacock</i>, was also taken in battle."</p>

<p>The Bey, looking through his telescope, saw a
small vessel leave the American fleet and approach
the forts. A man appeared to be taking soundings.
The Bey laid down the telescope. "I will accept
the admiral's terms," said he, and resumed the
combing of his beard.</p>

<p>Later he received Decatur with a great show of
respect. The American consul was also honored,
but the British was not treated so well. When a
brother of the prime minister paid the money over
to Decatur the Moor turned to the Englishman, and
said, "You see, sir, what Tunis is obliged to pay for
your insolence. You should feel ashamed of the
disgrace you have brought upon us. I ask you if
you think it just, first to violate our neutrality and
then to leave us to be destroyed or pay for your
aggressions?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
Having settled matters with Tunis, Decatur sailed
for Tripoli, and there sent his demands to the Pasha.
He asked thirty thousand dollars in payment for two
American prizes of war that had been recaptured by
the British cruiser <i class="ship">Paulina</i>, a salute of thirty-one
guns to be fired from the Pasha's palace in honor of
the United States flag, and that the treaty of peace
be signed on board the <i class="ship">Guerrière</i>.</p>

<p>The Pasha pretended to be offended, summoned his
twenty thousand Arab soldiers and manned his cannon;
but when he heard how Algiers and Tunis had
already made peace with Decatur, and saw that the
Americans were all prepared for battle, he changed
his tactics and sent the governor of Tripoli to the
flag-ship to treat for peace. The American consul
told Decatur that twenty-five thousand dollars would
make good the lost prize-ships, but that the Pasha
was holding ten Christians as slaves in Tripoli.
Decatur thereupon reduced the amount of his claim
on condition that the slaves should be released.
This was agreed to. The prisoners, two of whom
were Danes, and the others Sicilians, were sent to
the flag-ship, and by way of compliment the band of
the <i class="ship">Guerrière</i> went ashore and played American airs
to the delight of the people.</p>

<p>The American captain now ordered the rest of
his squadron to sail to Gibraltar, while the <i class="ship">Guerrière</i>
landed the prisoners at Sicily. As the flag-ship
came down the coast from Carthagena she met that
part of the Algerine fleet that had put into Malta<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
when the Americans first arrived in the Mediterranean.
The <i class="ship">Guerrière</i> was alone, and Decatur
thought that the Moors, finding him at such a disadvantage,
might break their treaty of peace, and
attack him. He called his men to the quarter-deck.
"My lads," said he, "those fellows are approaching
us in a threatening manner. We have whipped
them into a treaty, and if the treaty is to be broken
let them break it. Be careful of yourselves. Let
any man fire without orders at the peril of his life.
But let them fire first if they will, and we'll take the
whole of them!"</p>

<p>The decks were cleared, and every man stood
ready for action. The fleet of seven Algerine ships
sailed close to the single American frigate in line of
battle. The crews looked across the bulwarks at
each other, but not a word was said until the last
Algerine ship was opposite. "Where are you going?"
demanded the Moorish admiral.</p>

<p>"Wherever it pleases me," answered Decatur;
and the <i class="ship">Guerrière</i> sailed on her course.</p>

<p>Early in October there was a great gathering of
American ships at Gibraltar. Captain Bainbridge's
fleet, which included the seventy-four-gun ship of the
line <i class="ship">Independence</i>, was there when Decatur arrived.
The war between the United States and England
was only recently ended, and the presence of so
many ships of the young Republic at the English
Rock of Gibraltar caused much talk among the
Spaniards and other foreigners. The sight of ships<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
which had been English, but which were now
American, added to the awkward situation, and
more than one duel was fought on the Rock as the
result of disputes over the War of 1812.</p>

<p>The Dey of Algiers, left to his own advisers and
to the whispers of men who were jealous of the
United States' success, began to wish he had not
agreed to the treaty he had made with Decatur.
His own people told him that a true son of the
Prophet should never have humbled himself before
the Christian dogs. In addition the English government
agreed to pay him nearly four hundred
thousand dollars to ransom twelve thousand prisoners
of Naples and Sardinia that he was holding.
Before everything else the Dey was greedy. Therefore
when Captain Oliver Hazard Perry, the hero of
the battle of Lake Erie, brought out in the <i class="ship">Java</i> a
copy of the treaty after it had been ratified by the
United States Senate, and it was presented to the
Dey by the American consul, William Shaler, the
ruler of Algiers pretended that the United States
had changed the treaty, and complained of the way
in which Decatur had dealt with the Algerine ships.
Next day he refused to meet Mr. Shaler again, and
sent the treaty back to him, saying that the Americans
were unworthy of his confidence. Mr. Shaler
hauled down the flag at his consulate, and boarded
the <i class="ship">Java</i>.</p>

<p>Fortunately there were five American ships near
Algiers; and these were made ready to open fire on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
the Moorish vessels in the harbor. Plans were also
made for a night attack. The small boats of the
fleet were divided into two squadrons, to be filled by
twelve hundred volunteer sailors. One division was
to make for the water battery and try to spike its
guns, while the other was to attack the batteries on
shore. Scaling-ladders were ready, and the men
were provided with boarding-spikes; but shortly
before they were to embark the captain of a French
ship in the harbor got word of the plan and carried
the information to the Dey. The latter was well
frightened, and immediately sent word that he
would do whatever his good friends from America
wanted. The next day Mr. Shaler landed again,
and the Dey signed the treaty.</p>

<p>The fleet then called a second time on the Bey of
Tunis, who had been grumbling about his dissatisfaction
with Decatur's treatment. He too, however,
was most friendly when American war-ships poked
their noses toward his palace. After that the Barbary
pirates let American merchantmen trade in peace,
although an American squadron of four ships was
kept in the Mediterranean to see that the Dey, and
the Bey, and the Pasha did not forget, and go back
to their old tricks.</p>

<p>So it was that Decatur put an end to the African
pirates, so far as the United States was concerned,
and taught them that sailors of the young Republic,
far away though it was, were not to be made slaves
by greedy Moorish rulers.</p>

<span class="larger">THE FATE OF LOVEJOY'S PRINTING-PRESS</span></h2>

<p>Ever since the thirteen colonies that lay along the
Atlantic coast had become a nation ambitious men
had heard the call, "Go West, young man, go
West!" There was plenty of fertile land in the
country beyond the Alleghany Mountains, and it was
free to any who would settle on it. Adventure
beckoned men to come and help in founding new
states, and many, who thought the villages of New
England already overcrowded, betook themselves
to the inviting West. One such youth was Elijah
Parrish Lovejoy, who came from the little town of
Albion, in Maine, and who, after graduating at
Waterville College, had become a school-teacher.
This did not satisfy him; he wanted to see more of
the world than lay in the village of his birth, and
when he was twenty-five years old, in May, 1827, he
set out westward.</p>

<p>The young man was a true son of the Puritans,
brought up to believe in many ideas that were already
often in conflict with the views of men of the
South and West. He reached the small city of St.
Louis, in the pioneer country of Missouri, and there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
he found a chance to teach school. He wrote for
several newspapers that were being started, and in
the course of the next year edited a political paper
that was urging the election of Henry Clay as President.
His interest in politics grew, and he might
have sought some public office himself had he not
suddenly become convinced that he was meant to be
a minister, and determined to prepare for that work
at Princeton Seminary. When he returned to St.
Louis in 1833 his friends helped him to found a
weekly religious paper called the <i class="publication">St. Louis Observer</i>.</p>

<p>The editor found time from his newspaper work
to ride into the country and preach at the small
churches that were springing up at every crossroads.
Missouri was more southern than northern, and he
saw much of slave-owning people. It was not long
before he decided that negro slavery was wrong,
and that the only way to right the wrong was to do
away with it altogether. He began to attack slavery
in his newspaper and in his sermons, and soon slavery
men in that part of Missouri came to consider
him as one of their most bitter foes.</p>

<p>Lovejoy had married, and expected to make St.
Louis his permanent home. But neither all the men
who were interested in the <i class="publication">Observer</i>, nor all the
members of his church, approved of his arguments
against slaveholding, and when he was away at a
religious meeting the proprietors of his paper issued
a statement promising that the editor would deal
more gently with the question of slavery in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
future. When Lovejoy returned and read this statement
he was indignant; he was not a man to fear
public opinion, and he attacked his enemies more
ardently than ever.</p>

<p>The law of the land permitted slavery, and many
of the chief citizens in the frontier country approved
of it. They hated the Abolitionists, as those who
wanted to do away with slavery were called. When
men were suspected of having helped to free slaves,
or of sheltering runaway negroes, they were taken
into the country and given two hundred lashes with
a whip as a lesson. Sometimes Abolitionists were
tarred and feathered and ridden out of town; often
their houses were burned and their property destroyed.
Lovejoy knew that he might have to face
all this, but the spirit of the Puritan stock from
which he sprang would not let him turn from his
course.</p>

<p>He went on printing articles against the evils of
slavery, he denounced the right of a white man to
separate colored husbands and wives, parents and
children, brothers and sisters, or to send his slaves
to the market to be sold to the highest bidder, or to
whip or ill-use them as if they had no feelings.</p>

<p>There was danger that the young editor would be
mobbed, and the owners of the <i class="publication">Observer</i> took the
paper out of his charge. Friends, however, who believed
in a free press, bought it, and gave it back to
him. Waves of public opinion, now for Lovejoy,
now against him, swept through St. Louis. By the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
end of 1835 mobs had attacked Abolitionists in Boston,
New York, and Philadelphia, and the news
fanned the flames of resentment against them in Missouri.</p>

<p>Lovejoy had good reason to know the danger of
his position. One September day he went out to a
camp-meeting at the little town of Potosi. He
learned that two men had waited half a day in the
village, planning to tar and feather him when he arrived,
but he was late, and they had left. When he
returned to St. Louis he found that handbills had
been distributed through the city, calling on the people
to tear down the office of the <i class="publication">Observer</i>. A
newspaper named the <i class="publication">Missouri Argus</i> urged patriotic
men to mob the New England editor. Crowds,
gathered on street corners, turned dark, lowering
looks upon him as he passed, and every mail brought
him threatening letters. He would not, however,
stop either writing or preaching against slavery.</p>

<p>His work constantly called him on journeys to
small towns, sometimes several days' ride from his
home. Late in 1835 he was at a meeting in Marion
when reports came that St. Louis was in an uproar,
that men who opposed slavery were being whipped
in the streets, and that no one suspected of being an
Abolitionist would be allowed to stay there. Lovejoy
had left his wife ill in bed. He started to ride
back, a friend going some seventy miles with him,
half of the journey. The friend urged him not to
stay in St. Louis, pointing out that his young and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
delicate wife would have to suffer as well as he.
Travelers they met all warned him that he would not
be safe in the city. He rode on to St. Charles,
where he had left his wife. He talked with her, and
she told him to go on to his newspaper office if he
thought duty called him there.</p>

<p>St. Louis was all excitement and alarm. The
newspapers had attacked the <i class="publication">Observer</i> so bitterly
that the owners had stopped printing it. A mob had
planned to wreck the office, but had postponed the
task for a few days. Men went to Lovejoy and told
him he would not be safe in the streets by day or
night. Even the men of his church would not stand
by him, and a religious paper declared "that they
would soon free the church of the rotten sheep in
it," by which they meant Elijah Lovejoy and others
who opposed slavery.</p>

<p>This Yankee, however, like many others who had
gone to that border country in the days when bitterness
ran high, had a heroic sense of duty. He wrote
and printed a letter to the people, stating that men
had no right to own their brothers, no matter what
the law might say. The letter caused more excitement
than ever.</p>

<p>The owners of the <i class="publication">Observer</i> went to Lovejoy and
requested him to retire as its editor. For two days
it was a question what the angry mobs would do to
him. Then a little better feeling set in. Men came
to him, and told him that he must go on printing his
paper or there would be no voice of freedom in all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
that part of the country. A friend bought the newspaper
from its owners, and urged Lovejoy to write
as boldly as before. This friend, however, suggested
that he should move the newspaper across the state
line to Alton, Illinois, where feeling was not so intense.
Lovejoy agreed, and set out for Alton; but
while he was preparing to issue the paper there the
same friend and others wrote him that his pen was
so much needed in St. Louis that he must come back.
He did so, and the <i class="publication">Observer</i> continued its existence
in St. Louis until June, 1836.</p>

<p>There was so much strife and ill feeling, however,
in Missouri that the editor decided his newspaper
would be better supported, and would exert more influence,
in Illinois. Accordingly he arranged to
move his printing-press to the town of Alton in July.
Just before he left St. Louis he published severe
criticisms of a judge of that city who had sided with
slave-owners, and these articles roused even greater
resentment among the rabble who hated Lovejoy's
freedom of speech.</p>

<p>If some of the people of Alton were glad to have
this fearless editor come to their town, many were
not. Slavery was too sore a subject for them to
wish it talked about publicly. Many people all
through that part of the country looked upon an
Abolitionist as a man who delighted in stirring up
ill feeling. Lovejoy sent his printing-press to Alton
by steamboat, and it was delivered at the wharf on
a Sunday morning, about daybreak. The steamboat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
company had agreed to land the press on Monday,
and Lovejoy refused to move it from the dock on the
Sabbath. Early Monday morning five or six men
went down to the river bank and destroyed the
printing-press.</p>

<p>This was the young editor's welcome by the lawless
element, but next day the better class of citizens,
thoroughly ashamed of the outrage, met and pledged
themselves to repay Lovejoy for the loss of his
press. These people denounced the act of the mob,
but at the same time they expressed their disapproval
of Abolitionists. They wanted order and quiet, and
hoped that Lovejoy would not stir up more trouble.</p>

<p>The editor bought a new press and issued his
first paper in Alton on September 8, 1836. Many
people subscribed to it, and it appeared regularly
until the following August. Lovejoy, however,
would speak his mind, and again and again declared
that he was absolutely opposed to slavery, and that
the evil custom must come to an end. This led to
murmurs from the slavery party, and slanders were
spread concerning the editor's character. All freedom-loving
men had to weather such storms in those
days, and Lovejoy, like a great many others, stuck
to his principles at a heavy cost.</p>

<p>The murmurs and slanders grew. On July 8,
1837, posters announced that a meeting would be
held at the Market House to protest against the
articles in the <i class="publication">Alton Observer</i>. The meeting condemned
Lovejoy's writings and speeches, and voted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
that Abolitionism must be suppressed in the town.
This was the early thunder that heralded the approach
of a gathering storm.</p>

<p>The Yankee editor showed no intention of giving
up his stand against slavery, but preached and wrote
against it at every opportunity. As a result threats
of destroying the press of the <i class="publication">Observer</i> were heard on
the streets of Alton, and newspapers in neighboring
cities encouraged ill feeling against the editor. The
<i class="publication">Missouri Republic</i>, a paper printed in St. Louis, tried
to convince the people of Alton that it was a public
danger to have such men as Lovejoy in their midst,
and condemned the Anti-Slavery Societies that were
being formed in that part of the country. Two attempts
were made to break into his printing-office
during the early part of the summer, but each time
the attackers were driven off by Lovejoy's friends.</p>

<p>The editor went to a friend's house to perform a
marriage ceremony on the evening of August 21,
1837. His wife and little boy were ill at home, and
on his return he stopped at an apothecary's to get
some medicine for them. His house was about a
half mile out of town. As he left the main street he
met a crowd of men and boys. They did not recognize
him at once, and he hurried past them; but
soon some began to suspect who he was, and
shouted his name to the rest. Those in the rear
urged the leaders to attack him, but those in front
held back; some began to throw sticks and stones at
him, and one, armed with a club, pushed up to him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
denouncing him for being an Abolitionist. At last a
number linked arms and pushed past him, and then
turning about in the road stopped him. There were
cries of "Tar and feather him," "Ride him on a
rail," and other threats. Lovejoy told them they
might do as they pleased with him, but he had a request
to make; his wife was ill, and he wanted some
one to take the medicine to her without alarming
her. One of the men volunteered to do this. Then
the editor, standing at bay, argued with them.
"You had better let me go home," he said; "you
have no right to detain me; I have never injured
you." There was more denouncing, jostling and
shoving, but the leaders, after a short talk, allowed
Lovejoy to go on toward his house.</p>

<p>Meantime, however, another band had gone to the
newspaper office between ten and eleven o'clock, and,
seeing by the lights in the building that men were
still at work there, had begun to throw stones at the
windows. A crowd gathered to watch the attack.
The mayor and some of the leading citizens hurried
to the building, and argued with the ringleaders. A
prominent merchant told them that if they would
wait until the next morning he would break into the
newspaper office with them, and help them take out
the press and the other articles, stow them on a boat,
put the editor on top, and send them all down the
Mississippi River together. But the crowd did not
want to wait. The stones began to strike some of
Lovejoy's assistants inside the building, and they ran<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
out by a rear door. As soon as the office was empty
the leaders rushed in and broke the printing-press,
type, and everything else in the building. Next
morning the slavery men in Alton said that the Abolitionist
had been silenced for the time, at least. They
looked upon Lovejoy, and men of his kind, as a
thorn in the flesh of their peaceful community.</p>

<p>There were still a small number of "freedom-loving"
people in Alton, however, and these stood
back of Elijah Lovejoy. Although two printing-presses
had now been destroyed, these men called a
meeting and decided that the <i class="publication">Observer</i> must continue
to be printed. Money was promised, and the
editor prepared to set up his press for the third time.
He issued a short note to the public, in which he
said: "I now appeal to you, and all the friends of
law and order, to come to the rescue. If you will
sustain me, by the help of God, the press shall be
again established at this place, and shall be sustained,
come what will. Let the experiment be fairly tried,
whether the liberty of speech and of the press is to be
enjoyed in Illinois or not." The money was raised,
and the dauntless spokesman for freedom sent to
Cincinnati for supplies for his new office.</p>

<p>That autumn enemies scattered pamphlets accusing
Lovejoy and other Abolitionists of various crimes
against the country. Although few people believed
them, the circulars increased the hostile feelings, and
disturbed many of the editor's friends. Some of the
latter began to doubt whether the <i class="publication">Observer</i> ought to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
continue its stirring articles. Some thought it should
be only a religious paper. But Lovejoy answered
that he felt it was his duty to speak out in protest
against the great evil of slavery. He finally offered
to resign, if the supporters of the paper thought it
best for him to do so. They could not come to any
decision, and so let him continue his course.</p>

<p>The third printing-press arrived at Alton on September
21st, while Lovejoy was away attending a
church meeting. The press was landed from the
steamboat a little after sunset, and was protected by
a number of friends of the <i class="publication">Observer</i>. It was carted
to a large warehouse to be stored. As it passed
through the street some men cried, "There goes the
Abolition press; stop it, stop it!" but no one tried to
injure it. The mayor of Alton declared that the
press should be protected, and placed a constable at
the door of the warehouse, with orders to remain till
a certain hour. As soon as this man left, ten or
twelve others, with handkerchiefs tied over their faces
as disguise, broke into the warehouse, rolled the
press across the street to the river, broke it into
pieces, and threw it into the Mississippi. The mayor
arrived and protested, but the men paid no attention
to him.</p>

<p>Lovejoy's business had called him to the town of
St. Charles, near St. Louis, and he preached there
while his third press was being attacked. After his
sermon in the evening he was sitting chatting with a
clergyman and another friend when a young man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
came in, and slipped a note into his hand. The note
read:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="in0">"<span class="smcap">Mr. Lovejoy</span>:</p>

<p class="p0">"Be watchful as you come from church to-night.</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="smcap">A Friend.</span>"<br />
</p></div></div>

<p>Lovejoy showed the note to the two other men,
and the clergyman invited him to stay at his house.
The editor declined, however, and walked to his
mother-in-law's residence with his two friends. No
one stopped them, and when they came to the house
Lovejoy and the clergyman went in, and sat down to
chat in a room on the second floor. About ten
o'clock they heard a knock on the door at the foot of
the stairs. Mrs. Lovejoy's mother went to the door,
and asked what was wanted. Voices answered,
"We want to see Mr. Lovejoy; is he in?" The
editor called down, "Yes, I am here." As soon as
the door was opened, two men rushed up-stairs, and
into the sitting-room. They ordered Lovejoy to go
down-stairs, and when he resisted, struck him with
their fists. Mrs. Lovejoy heard the noise, and came
running from her room. A crowd now filled the
hall, and she had to fight her way through them.
Several men tried to drag the editor out of the
house, but his wife clung to him, and aided by her
mother and sister finally persuaded the assailants to
leave.</p>

<p>Exhausted by the struggle, Mrs. Lovejoy fainted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
While her husband was trying to help her, the mob
came back, and, paying no attention to the sick
woman, insisted that they were going to ride Lovejoy
out of town. By this time a few respectable
citizens had heard the noise, and came to his aid.
A second time the rabble was driven away; but they
stayed in the yard, and made the night hideous with
their threats to the Abolitionist. Presently some of
the men went up to Lovejoy's room the third time,
and one of them gave him a note, which demanded
that he leave St. Charles by ten o'clock the next
morning. Lovejoy's friends begged him to send
out an answer promising that he would leave. Although
he at first declined to do this, he finally
yielded to their urging. He wrote, "I have already
taken my passage in the stage, to leave to-morrow
morning, at least by nine o'clock." This note was
carried out to the crowd on the lawn, and read to
them. His friends thought the mob would scatter
after that, and they did for a time; but after listening
to violent speeches returned again. The noise
was now so threatening that Lovejoy's friends begged
him to fly from the house. His wife added her
pleadings to theirs, and at last he stole out unnoticed
by a door at the rear. He hated to leave his wife in
such a dangerous situation, however, and so, after
waiting a short time, he went back. His friends reproached
him for returning, and their reproaches
were justified, for, like hounds scenting the fox, the
mob menaced the house more noisily than ever.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
Lovejoy saw that he must leave again in order to
protect his wife and friends. This he succeeded in
doing, and walked about a mile to the residence of a
Major Sibley. This friend lent him a horse, and he
rode out of town to the house of another friend four
miles away. Next day Mrs. Lovejoy joined him,
and they went on together to Alton.</p>

<p>One of the very first people they met in Alton
was a man from St Charles who had been among
those who had broken into their house the night
before. Mrs. Lovejoy was alarmed at seeing him in
Illinois, because the mob in St. Charles had declared
that they were going to drive Lovejoy out of that
part of the country. In order to quiet her fears her
husband asked some friends to come to his house,
and ten men, well armed, spent the next night guarding
it, while he himself kept a loaded musket at his
side. The storm-clouds were gathering about his
devoted head.</p>

<p>Even the leading citizens of this Illinois town now
felt that it was Lovejoy's own fault if his newspaper
was attacked. They hated mobs, but most of them
hated Abolitionists even more. If he would stop
attacking slavery, the crowds would stop attacking
him. It was evident that the lawless element did
not intend to let him continue to print his newspaper,
and it was almost as clear that the mayor
and authorities were not going to protect him.
Three times now his press had been destroyed.</p>

<p>This son of the Puritans was not to be driven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
from his purpose by threats or blows, but he was
forced to see that it was a great waste of money to
have one press after another thrown into the Mississippi
River. His friends in the town of Quincy
urged him to set up his press there, and he felt
much inclined to do so. He decided to wait, however,
until the next meeting of the Presbyterian
Synod, when he would learn whether the men of
his church sided with him or not. This meeting
ended in discussion, breaking up along the old lines
of those who were friends and those who were
enemies of slavery. Some of the members had
already joined Anti-Slavery Societies, while others,
although they were opposed to mob-violence, did
not approve of the newspaper's attack on slaveholding
citizens. In a stirring speech Lovejoy said
that they were to decide whether the press should be
free in that part of the United States. He ended
with an appeal for justice. "I have no personal
fears," he declared. "Not that I feel able to contest
the matter with the whole community. I know
perfectly well I am not. I know, sir, that you can
tar and feather me, hang me up, or put me into the
Mississippi, without the least difficulty. But what
then? Where shall I go? I have been made to
feel that if I am not safe at Alton, I shall not be safe
anywhere. I recently visited St. Charles to bring
home my family, and was torn from their frantic
embrace by a mob. I have been beset night and
day at Alton. And now if I leave here and go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
elsewhere, violence may overtake me in my retreat,
and I have no more claim upon the protection of
any other community than I have upon this; and I
have concluded, after consultation with my friends,
and earnestly seeking counsel of God, to remain at
Alton, and here to insist on protection in the exercise
of my rights."</p>

<p>This speech made a great impression upon its
hearers. The words were those of a man who had
thought long upon his subject, and had made up his
mind as to what he should do. He expressed no
enmity toward the men who had treated him so ill,
and he did not complain of the members of his own
church who were lukewarm in their support. A
man who was present said that Lovejoy's speech
reminded him of the words of St. Paul when brought
before Festus, or of Martin Luther speaking to the
council at Worms.</p>

<p>Having decided to stay, Lovejoy ordered his
fourth printing-press. This was due to arrive early
in November, and as the time drew near there was
no little excitement and anxiety among the friends of
peace in the town. Whenever the puff of a steamboat
was heard men hurried to the banks of the
Mississippi. Some meant to defend the press from
attack; others meant to hurl it into the river as
they had already done with its predecessors. The
press had an eventful journey. The first plan was
to land it at a place called Chippewa, about five
miles down the river, and then carry it secretly into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
Alton. But the roads grew bad, and this plan was
abandoned. The press reached St. Louis on Sunday
night, November 5th, and it was arranged that
the steamer should land it at Alton about three o'clock
Tuesday morning. As soon as this was known,
Lovejoy and his friend Gilman went to the mayor
and told him of the threat that had been made
to destroy the press, asking him to appoint special
constables to protect it. The town council voted
that Lovejoy and his friends be requested not to
persist in setting up an Abolition press in Alton,
but the mayor refused to sign this request.</p>

<p>Monday night forty or fifty citizens, intent on seeing
that the press was protected, gathered at the
warehouse of Godfrey, Gilman and Company where
the press was to be stored. Some thirty of them
formed a volunteer company, with one of the city
constables in command. They were armed with
rifles and muskets loaded with buckshot or small
balls. The editor of the <i class="publication">Observer</i> was not there.
Only a night or two before his house had been
attacked, and his sister had narrowly escaped serious
injury. So he arranged with a brother, who was
staying with him, to take turns standing guard
at his house and at the office.</p>

<p>At three o'clock the steamboat arrived at the
dock. Lovejoy's enemies had stationed sentinels
along the river, and as the boat passed they gave
the alarm by blowing horns, so that when the dock
was reached a large crowd had gathered. Some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
one called the mayor, and he came down to the
warehouse. He begged the volunteer company to
keep quiet, and said he himself would see to the
safe storing of the press. No serious trouble followed.
The crowd watched the stevedores carry
the press to the warehouse, but did not attack it,
except to throw a few stones. It was stood in the
garret of the stone warehouse, safe from the
enemy.</p>

<p>On Tuesday every one knew that the "Abolition
press" had arrived, and Tuesday night the same
volunteers went down to the warehouse again.
Everything was quiet, and by nine o'clock all but
about a dozen left the place. Lovejoy stayed by the
press, it being his brother's turn to guard his house.
The warehouse stood high above the river, apart
from other buildings, with considerable open space
on the sides to the river and to the north.</p>

<p>About ten o'clock that night loafers and stragglers
began to come from saloons and restaurants, and
gather in the streets that led to the warehouse.
Some thirty, armed with muskets, pistols, and
stones, marched to the door, and demanded admittance.
Mr. Gilman, one of the owners of the warehouse,
standing at the garret door, asked what they
wanted. The leader answered, "The press." Mr.
Gilman said that he would not give up the press.
"We have no ill feelings toward any of you," he
added, "and should regret to harm you; but we are
authorized by the mayor to defend our property, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
shall do so with our lives." The mob leader answered
that they meant to have the press at any
cost, and leveled a pistol at Mr. Gilman, who drew
back from the door. The crowd began to throw
stones, and broke a number of windows. Then they
fired through the windows. The men inside returned
the shots. One or two of the mob were
wounded; and this checked them for a time. Soon,
however, others came with ladders, and materials
for setting fire to the roof of the building. They
kept on the side of the warehouse where there were
no windows, and where they could not be driven
away by the defenders. It was a moonlight night,
and the small company inside the building did not
dare go out into the open space in front. At this
point the mayor appeared and carried a flag of truce
through the mob to Lovejoy's friends, asking that
the press be given up, and the men in the warehouse
depart peacefully without other property being
destroyed. He told them that unless they surrendered
the mob would set fire to the warehouse.
They answered that they had gathered to defend
their property, and intended to do it. He admitted
that they had a perfect right to do this, and went
back to report the result of his mission to the leaders.
Outside a shout went up, "Fire the building,
drive out the Abolitionists, burn them out!" A
great crowd had gathered, but there were no officers
of the law ready to defend the press.</p>

<p>Ladders were placed against the building, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
roof was set on fire. Five men volunteered to go
out and try to prevent the firing. They left the
building by the riverside, fired at the men on the
ladder, and drove them away. The crowd drew
back, while the five returned to the store. The mob
did not venture to put up their ladder again, and
presently Lovejoy and two or three others opened a
door and looked out. There appeared to be no one
on this side, and Lovejoy stepped forward to reconnoiter.
Some of his enemies, however, were hidden
behind a pile of lumber, and one of them fired a
double-barreled gun. The editor was hit by five
balls. He turned around, ran up a flight of stairs in
the warehouse, and into the counting-room. There
he fell, dying a few minutes later.</p>

<p>With their leader killed some of the company
wanted to give up the battle, while others insisted
on fighting it out. They finally resolved to yield.
A clergyman went to one of the upper windows and
called out that Elijah Lovejoy had been killed and
that they would give up the press if they might be
allowed to go unmolested. The crowd answered
that they would shoot them all where they were.
One of the defenders determined to go out at any
risk and make terms. As soon as he opened the
door, he was fired upon and wounded. The roof
was now blazing, and one of their friends reached
a door and begged them to escape by the rear. All
but two or three laid down their arms, running out
at the southern door, and fled down the bank of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
river. The mob fired at them, but only one was
wounded. The crowd rushed into the warehouse,
threw the press out the window, breaking it into
pieces, and scattered the pieces in the Mississippi.
At two o'clock they had disappeared, having accomplished
their evil purpose of preventing a "free
press" in Alton.</p>

<p>Elijah Lovejoy was only thirty-five years old
when he met his martyr's death. His life in Missouri
and Illinois had been one constant fight
against slavery, and for liberty of speech. His Puritan
ancestry made it impossible for him to give up
the battle he knew to be right. The story of his
heroic struggle and death aroused lovers of liberty
all over the country, and newspapers everywhere
denounced the acts of the mob at Alton. Such acts
meant that men could not speak their minds on
public questions, and a "free press" had been one
of the dearest rights of American citizens. Men in
the North at that time had by no means agreed that
slavery must be abolished, but they did all believe in
the freedom of the press. For that cause Lovejoy
had been a martyr.</p>

<p>More than two decades were to pass before the
question of slavery was to be settled forever, and in
the years between 1837 and 1860 many men of the
same stock and stripe as Elijah Lovejoy were to
give up their lives in heroic defense of their belief in
freedom. He was one of the first of a long line of
heroes. His voice sounded a call that was to echo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
through the border states for years to come, inspiring
others to take up his cause. A freedom-loving
country should place among its noblest sons this
dauntless editor and preacher.</p>

<span class="larger">HOW MARCUS WHITMAN SAVED OREGON</span></h2>

<p>The Hudson's Bay Company, whose business
was to buy skins and furs from the American Indians,
had located a trading-post at Fort Walla
Walla, in the country of the Cayuse and Nez Percés
Indians. This was in what was known as Oregon
Territory in 1842, although it is now near the southeast
corner of the state of Washington. Here was
a very primitive settlement, the frame houses of a
few white men and the tents of Indians. Very little
effort had been made to grow grain or fruit or to
raise sheep or cattle, since the Hudson's Bay Company
wanted the Indians to be continually on the
hunt for furs, and discouraged them from turning
into farmers. Besides the traders and the Indians
there was a small missionary camp near at hand,
located on a beautiful peninsula made by two
branches of the Walla Walla River. This place
was called by the Indians Wai-i-lat-pui, meaning the
region of rye grass. Beyond the fertile ground on
the river's banks were borders of timber-land, and
beyond them plains stretching to the foot-hills of the
great Blue Mountains. In 1842 this wonderful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
country was free to any who cared to come and settle
there, but as yet very few had ventured so far
into the wilderness.</p>

<p>The chief man at the missionary camp, Dr.
Marcus Whitman, was called to Fort Walla Walla on
the first day of October, 1842, to see a sick man.
He found a score or so of traders and Hudson's Bay
clerks, almost all Englishmen, gathered there, and
accepted their invitation to stay to dinner. The men
were a genial company, and had already taken a
liking to Whitman, who was frank and amiable, and
an interesting story-teller. Gradually the conversation
at the dinner table came round to a subject that
was vastly important to the men present, although
the outside world seemed to be paying little attention
to it&mdash;to which country was this great territory
of Oregon to belong, to the United States or to
England? The general opinion appeared to be
that under the old treaties it would belong to the
country that settled it first.</p>

<p>In the midst of the discussion there was the sound
of hoof-beats outside, the door of the company's
office was flung open, and an express messenger
ran into the dining-room. "I'm just from Fort
Colville!" he cried. "A hundred and forty Englishmen
and Canadians are on the march to settle
here!"</p>

<p>There was instant excitement. A young priest
threw his cap in the air, shouting, "Hurrah for
Oregon&mdash;America's too late; we've got the country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>!"
The traders clapped each other on the
shoulder, and made a place for the messenger at the
head of the table. As he ate he told them how he
had ridden from the post three hundred and fifty
miles up the Columbia River to let all the fur-traders
know that the English were on the way to colonize
the country.</p>

<p>Marcus Whitman smiled, and pretended to enjoy
the celebration; but in reality he was already considering
whether he could not do something to save
this vast and fruitful region for his own nation. It
was an enormous tract of land, of untold wealth,
and stretching over a long reach of the Pacific coast.
As he considered, Whitman heard the Hudson's Bay
Company's men grow more and more excited, until
they declared that they intended to take possession
of all the country west to the Pacific slope the following
spring.</p>

<p>The missionary had been expecting this struggle
between the English and the Americans for the
ownership of Oregon, but had not thought it would
come to a head quite so soon. He left the men at
Fort Walla Walla as early as he could, and rode
back to the little settlement at Wai-i-lat-pui. There
he told his wife and friends the news he had learned
at the trading-post. "If our country is to have
Oregon," he said, "there is not a day to lose."</p>

<p>"But what can we do?" the others asked him.</p>

<p>"I must get to Washington as quick as I can, and
let them know the danger."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
His friends understood what that meant, a journey
on horseback across almost an entire continent,
through hostile Indians, over great rivers and mountain
ranges, and in the depths of winter. Some one
pointed out that under the rules of the American
Mission Board that had sent them into the far west
none of their number could leave his post without
consent from the headquarters in Boston. "Well,"
said Whitman, "if the Board dismisses me, I will do
what I can to save Oregon to the country. My life
is of but little worth if I can save this country to the
American people."</p>

<p>His wife, a brave, patriotic woman who had shared
his hard travels westward without a murmur, agreed
with him that he must go. They all insisted, however,
that he should have a companion. "Who will
go with me?" asked Whitman. In answer a man
who had only lately joined the small encampment,
Amos L. Lovejoy, immediately volunteered.</p>

<p>Urging upon their friends the need of keeping the
plan a secret from the Hudson's Bay Company fur-traders,
the two men quickly prepared, and left the
camp on October 3d. They had a guide, three
pack-mules, and for the start of their journey an
escort of a number of Cayuse braves, men of an Indian
tribe that was not large, but was wealthy, and
that seemed to have taken a liking to Whitman and
his friends at the mission settlement.</p>

<p>The leader himself had one fixed idea in his mind,
to reach Washington before Congress adjourned.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
He was convinced that only through his account of
the riches of Oregon could the government learn
what the country stood in danger of losing.</p>

<p>The little company got a good start, and with fresh
horses, riding southeast toward the border of what
is now the state of Idaho, they reached Fort Hall in
eleven days. Here was stationed Captain Grant,
who had always done his best to hinder immigration
into Oregon, and had induced many an American
settler to go no farther westward. He knew Whitman
of old, and six years before had tried to stop
his expedition to the Walla Walla River, but Whitman
had overcome his arguments, and had taken the
first wagon that ever crossed the Rocky Mountains
into Oregon. As he had tried to prevent Whitman
from going west before, so now he tried to prevent
him from going east. He told him that the Blackfeet
Indians had suddenly grown hostile to all white
men, that the Sioux and Pawnees were at war with
each other, and would let no one through their
country, and finally that the snow was already
twenty feet deep in the passes of the Rockies, and
travel through them was altogether out of the question.</p>

<p>This information was far from reassuring, and,
backed as it was by Captain Grant's entreaties and
almost by his commands, would have deterred many
a man from plunging into that winter wilderness.
Whitman, however, was a man who could neither be
turned aside nor discouraged. His answer to all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
protests at Fort Hall was to point to the official
permit he had carried west with him, ordering all
officers to protect and aid him in his travels, and
signed by Lewis Cass, Secretary of War, and to
declare that he intended to push on east, hostile
Indians, mountains, and blizzards notwithstanding.
Captain Grant saw that he could not stop Whitman,
and, much to his chagrin, had to let him pass the
fort.</p>

<p>The route Whitman had plotted out lay first east
and then south, in the general direction of the
present site of Salt Lake City. His objective points
were two small military posts, Fort Uintah and
Fort Uncompahgra. As soon as the two men left
Fort Hall they ran into terribly cold weather. The
deep snow kept them back, and they had to pick any
shelter they could find, and crawl slowly on, sometimes
taking a day to cover a few miles. At Fort
Uintah they procured a guide to the second post,
which was on the Grand River, and at the latter
point a Mexican agreed to show them the way to
Taos, a settlement in what is now the state of New
Mexico. So far their southeasterly course had
allowed them to skirt the high mountains, but here
they had to cross a range, and in the pass ran full
into a terrific snow-storm.</p>

<p>It was impossible to go forward in the teeth of
that gale, so Whitman, Lovejoy, and their guide
looked about for shelter. They found a rocky
defile with a mountain shoulder to protect it, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
led their horses and pack-mules into this pocket.
In this dark, cold place they stayed for ten days,
trying each morning to push on through the pass,
and being blown back each time. On the eleventh
day the wind had abated somewhat, and they tried
again. They went a short distance when, coming
around a corner, a fresh storm broke full upon
them, blinding and freezing the men, and pelting
the animals with frozen snow so that they were
almost uncontrollable.</p>

<p>The native guide now admitted that he was no
longer sure of the way, and refused to go any
farther. Clearly the only thing to be done was
to return for the eleventh time to the sheltered ravine.
But now the snow had drifted across their trail, and
none of the three men was at all certain of the road
back. Whitman dismounted, and kneeling in the
snow, prayed that they might be saved for the work
that they had to do.</p>

<p>Meantime the guide resolved to try an old hunting
expedient, and turned one of the lead mules loose.
The mule was confused at first, and stumbled about,
heading one way and then another, but finally
started to plunge back through the drifts as if to a
certain goal. "There," shouted the guide, "that
mule will find the camp if he can live long enough
in this storm to reach it." The men urged their
horses after the plunging beast, and slipping and
sliding and beating their half-frozen mounts, at last
came around the mountain shoulder and got in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
lee of the ravine. That bit of hunter's knowledge
and that mule had much to do with saving the great
northwest to the United States.</p>

<p>Once safe in this comparative shelter the guide
turned to Dr. Whitman. "I will go no farther,"
said he; "the way is impassable."</p>

<p>Whitman knew that the man meant what he said,
and he had just seen for himself what a storm could
do to travelers, but he said as positively in the
ravine as he had already said in the comfortable
protection of Fort Hall, "I must go on." He considered
their situation a minute, and then said to
Lovejoy, "You stay in camp, and I'll return with
the guide to the fort and get a new man."</p>

<p>The pack-mules needed rest, and so this plan was
agreed to. Whitman and the obstinate guide went
back, while Lovejoy waited in the ravine and tried
to nourish the mules by gathering brush and the
inner bark of willows for them to eat. Fortunately
mules can live on almost anything.</p>

<p>For a week Lovejoy stayed in the ravine, only
partly sheltered from wind and snow, before Whitman
returned. He brought a new guide with him,
and, the storm having now lessened, the little party
was able to get through the pass and strike out for
the post at Taos.</p>

<p>The route Whitman was taking was far from
direct, was in fact at least a thousand miles longer
than if they had headed directly east from Walla
Walla, but they were avoiding the highest Rockies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
and were traveling to a certain extent in the shelter
of the ranges, where there was much less snow and
plenty of fire-wood could be found. The winter of
1842-43 was very cold, and if they had journeyed
direct the continual storms and lack of all fuel for
camp-fires might have caused a different ending
to their cross-country ride. As it was they suffered
continually from frozen feet and hands and ears, and
lost a number of days when one or the other could
not sit his saddle.</p>

<p>Traveling far to the south they came to the Grand
River, one of the most dangerous rivers in the west.
The current, even in summer, is rapid, deep, and
cold. Now, in winter, solid ice stretched two hundred
feet from either shore, and between the ice
was a rushing torrent over two hundred feet wide.</p>

<p>The guide studied the swift, boiling current, and
shook his head. "It's too risky to try to cross," he
declared.</p>

<p>"We must cross, and at once," said Whitman
positively. He dismounted, and, picking out a
willow tree near the shore, cut a pole about eight
feet long. He carried this back to his horse,
mounted, and put the pole on his shoulder, gripping
it with his left arm. "Now you shove me off," he
said to the men. Lovejoy and the guide did as he
ordered, and Whitman and his horse were pushed
into the stream. They disappeared under the
water, but soon came up, struggling and swimming.
In a minute or two the horse struck rocky bottom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
and could wade. Whitman jumped off, broke the
ice with his pole, and helped the animal to get to
the shore.</p>

<p>Meantime Lovejoy and the guide, breaking the
ice on their side, headed their horses and the pack-mules
into the river. Animals in that country are
always ready to follow where their leader goes, and
they all swam and splashed their way across. The
men found plenty of wood at hand, and soon had a
roaring fire, by which they camped, and dried out
thoroughly before riding on.</p>

<p>The delays caused by their stay in the mountains
and physical hardships had made their store of provisions
run low. At one time they had to kill a dog
that had joined them, and a little later one of the
mules for food. Eating and sleeping little, and
pushing on as rapidly as they could they finally
reached the old city of Santa Fé, the metropolis of
the southwest. But here Whitman only stopped
long enough to buy fresh provisions.</p>

<p>They were now heading for Bent's Fort near the
head of the Arkansas River. The storms in the hills
were past, and they were riding over vast treeless
prairies, where there was plenty of grass for the
horses, and any amount of wild game if they could
have stopped long enough to replenish their larder
with it. Again and again they were forced to prairie
expedients. Once, as they reached one of the tributaries
of the Arkansas River, after a long and tedious
day on the plains, they found the river frozen over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
with a layer of smooth, clear ice, hardly strong
enough to bear a man. They must have wood, but
although there was plenty of it on the other side,
there was none on their shore of the stream. Whitman
took the ax from his kit, and lying down on the
thin ice, contrived with great caution and patience
to make his way across. On the other bank he cut
long poles and short cross-pieces. These he pushed
across the ice to Lovejoy, and with them they made
enough of a bridge for the latter to urge the horses
and mules to try to cross. They all got over safely,
though with much slipping and splashing. In cutting
his last pole Whitman split the ax-helve. When
they camped he bound the break with a deerskin
thong, but that night a thieving wolf found the ax
at the edge of the camp, wanted the fresh deerskin,
and dragged away ax and thong. The loss would
have been very serious if it had happened earlier in
their journey.</p>

<p>When they were within four days' ride of Bent's
Fort they met a caravan traveling toward Taos.
The leader told Whitman that a party of mountaineers
was about leaving Bent's Fort for St. Louis,
but added that Whitman and Lovejoy, hampered by
their pack animals, would not be in time to join them.</p>

<p>Whitman was very anxious to join the mountaineers
if he could, and decided to leave Lovejoy and
the guide with the pack-mules. Taking the fastest
horse, and a small store of food, he rode on alone,
hoping to catch the party. To do this he would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
have to travel on Sunday, something they had not
done before.</p>

<p>Lovejoy saw Dr. Whitman start on his ride, but
when the former reached Bent's Fort four days later
he was astonished to find that Whitman had not
arrived there, nor been heard from. As that part of
the country was full of packs of gray wolves, now
half-starved on account of the snow, Lovejoy was
alarmed.</p>

<p>If not a prey to the wolves, Whitman must be
lost; so his friend took a good guide from the Fort
and started to search for him. He traveled up-river
a hundred miles, and there fell in with Indians who
told him of a lost white man who was trying to find
the Fort, and whom they had directed down the
river. Lovejoy went back, and late that afternoon
saw Whitman come riding in, convinced that his
journey had been so much delayed because he had
traveled on Sunday.</p>

<p>The party of mountaineers had already left, but a
messenger had been sent after them, and they stayed
in camp, waiting for Whitman. Tired as he was, he
started out immediately with a new guide, particularly
eager to join this company, because they were
now nearing the outposts of civilization, where the
worst white men and Indians beset the pioneers.
Lovejoy waited at Bent's Fort, and went east with
the next caravan that started for St. Louis.</p>

<p>Whitman came safely through to St. Louis, where
he had friends. He was at once surrounded by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
trappers and traders in Indian goods and furs who
wanted news of the plains. In his turn he asked
news of Congress, and learned that the Ashburton
Treaty, settling a part of the boundary between
Canada and the United States, had been approved
and signed, but that the question of Oregon had not
been settled, and from the reports of what had been
said in the debates at Washington he knew that
none of the American statesmen realized what a
great prize Oregon Territory was.</p>

<p>He must reach the capital before Congress adjourned
if possible. The rivers were frozen, and he
had to rely on a journey by stage, slow at all times,
but especially so in midwinter. He toiled slowly
eastward, taking one coach after another, swinging
and swaying and rocking across the center of the
country, and reaching the capital in time to plead
the cause of the northwest.</p>

<p>Washington was used to many strange types of
men in those pioneer days, but even among such
Marcus Whitman was a striking figure. He was of
medium height, compact of build, with big shoulders
and a large head. His hair was iron gray, and that,
as well as his moustache and beard, had not been cut
for four months. He was of pioneer type, living so
long among Indians and trappers, and watching so
constantly for wolves and bears, that he seemed awkward
and uncouth in an eastern city. His clothes
were a coarse fur jacket with buckskin breeches, fur
leggings, and boot moccasins. Over these he wore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
a buffalo overcoat, with a head-hood for bad weather.
He did not show an inch of woven garment.</p>

<p>Whitman reached Washington in March, 1843,
and immediately urged his case before President
Tyler, Secretary of State Daniel Webster, and many
congressmen. He found the densest ignorance
concerning Oregon Territory, a tract of territory
which has since been divided into the three states of
Washington, Oregon, and Idaho. A senator had
said of that territory, "What is the character of this
country? As I understand it there are seven hundred
miles this side of the Rocky Mountains that
are uninhabitable; where rain never falls; mountains
wholly impassable, except through gaps and
depressions, to be reached only by going hundreds
of miles out of the direct course.... Of
what use would it be for agricultural purposes?
I would not, for that purpose, give a pinch of snuff
for the whole territory. I wish the Rocky Mountains
were an impassable barrier. If there was
an embankment of even five feet to be removed
I would not consent to expend five dollars to remove
it and enable our population to go there." Another
statesman declared, "With the exception of land
along the Willamette and strips along other water
courses, the whole country is as irreclaimable and
barren a waste as the Desert of Sahara. Nor is this
the worst; the climate is so unfriendly to human
life that the native population has dwindled away
under the ravages of malaria." And newspaper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
opinions were no more favorable. The Louisville
<i class="publication">Journal</i> wrote, "Of all the countries upon
the face of the earth Oregon is one of the least
favored by heaven. It is the mere riddlings of
creation. It is almost as barren as Sahara and
quite as unhealthy as the Campagna of Italy.
Russia has her Siberia and England has her Botany
Bay, and if the United States should ever need
a country to which to banish her rogues and
scoundrels, the utility of such a region as Oregon
would be demonstrated. Until then, we are perfectly
willing to leave this magnificent country
to the Indians, trappers and buffalo hunters that
roam over its sand-banks."</p>

<p>Marcus Whitman had ridden four thousand miles,
and starved, frozen, and never rested in order to
overcome such opinions. The President and Daniel
Webster were polite to him, but neither seemed
to think much of the northwest. As he was
describing the richness of the country, its fertile
soil, great forests, precious minerals, and delightful
climate, Webster interrupted. "But Oregon is
shut off by impassable mountains and a great
desert, which make a wagon road impossible," said
he. Whitman answered, "Six years ago I was
told there was no wagon road to Oregon, and
it was impossible to take a wagon there, and yet in
despite of pleadings and almost threats, I took
a wagon over the road and have it now." The
missionary's earnest, forceful manner impressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
both President Tyler and Secretary Webster, and
gradually they began to think it might be worth
while to protect the claim of the United States
to that country. Finally Whitman said, "All I
ask is that you won't barter away Oregon, or
allow English interference until I can lead a band
of stalwart American settlers across the plains:
for this I will try to do."</p>

<p>"Dr. Whitman," answered President Tyler, "your
long ride and frozen limbs speak for your courage
and patriotism; your missionary credentials are
good vouchers for your character;" and he granted
the request.</p>

<p>This was all Whitman wanted, because he believed
that under the treaty then in force between
the United States and England the nation that
should colonize the country was to own it. He
knew that up to that time the English Hudson's
Bay Company had bought out all American traders
or driven out all settlers, but he hoped he could
lead enough emigrants there now to hold it for
the United States.</p>

<p>He next went to the American Missionary Board
in Boston, which had originally sent him out to
Oregon. There he met with cold treatment, and
was told he should not have left the camp at Wai-i-lat-pui
without permission from Boston, and that
his trip across the continent was a wild-goose chase.
This unmerited rebuke must have hurt him sorely.
He was, however, so filled with eagerness to lead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
his party of pioneers west that he did not let it
daunt him, but went on with his preparations.
In this he was very much helped by his companion
Lovejoy, who was gathering a large number of
emigrants on the frontier awaiting Whitman's
return.</p>

<p>The meeting point of the emigrants was the
little town of Weston, not far from where Kansas
City now stands. Here and at various near-by
settlements the pioneers gathered early in the
year 1843, waiting for Dr. Whitman to join them,
and for the spring grass to grow high enough
to feed their cattle. As it happened, that year the
grass was late, and the caravan did not get under
way until the first week in June. Whitman himself
was delayed through the need of leaving careful
instructions for those who were to cross the plains
later in the year. The caravan started before Whitman
arrived, and he did not overtake the advance guard
until they had reached the Platte River. When
he did actually join the emigrants he looked after
everything, mending broken prairie wagons, cheering
tired mothers, acting as surgeon and doctor,
hunting out fords through quicksands and rivers,
searching for water and grass in the desert plains,
seeking new passes through the mountains, and
at night superintending the building of camp-fires
and keeping watch against an attack by wolves
or other wild animals.</p>

<p>The journey from the Platte River as far as Fort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
Hall, which was near the eastern border of Oregon
Territory, was much like other pioneer travels
through the west. Whitman had been over this
trail several times and the difficulties he encountered
were not new to him. At Fort Hall he had to
meet Captain John Grant again, who, as an agent of
the Fur Company, did not want new farmers to
settle in Oregon.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 568px;">
  <img id="ip_152" src="images/illo_158.jpg" width="568" height="369" alt="" /><br />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">The Last Six Hundred Miles Were the Hardest</span>
</div></div>

<p>Instead of appealing only to a few men Captain
Grant now spoke to several hundred resolute pioneers.
He told them of the terrors of the long
journey through the mountains and the impossibility
of hauling their heavy prairie wagons over
the passes; he recounted the failures of other pioneers
who had tried what they had planned to do;
he showed them in the corral wagons, farm tools,
and other pioneer implements that earlier emigrants
had had to leave when they ventured into the
mountains. He stated the difficulties so clearly
that this company was almost persuaded, as earlier
companies had been, to follow his suggestions,
leave their farming implements behind, and try
to make a settlement without any of the tools or
comforts that were so greatly needed in that country.
Whitman, however, spoiled Grant's plans. He said
to his followers, "Men, I have guided you thus
far in safety. Believe nothing you hear about
not being able to get your wagons through; every
one of you stick to your wagons and your goods.
They will be invaluable to you when you reach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
the end of your journey. I took a wagon over
to Oregon six years ago." The men believed their
leader, refused to obey Captain Grant, and prepared
to start on the trail into the high Rockies.</p>

<p>It was the last six hundred miles of the journey to
Oregon that usually made the most severe test of
the settlers' endurance. From Fort Hall the nature
of the traveling changed entirely, and was apt
to resemble the retreat of a disorganized army.
Earlier caravans, although they had taken Captain
Grant's advice and left many wagons, horses, and
camp comforts behind, had suffered untold hardships.
Oxen and horses, worn by their long trip
across the plains, and toiling for long stretches
through the high passes, were apt to perish in large
numbers and frequently fell dead in their yokes
on the road. Wagons already baked in the blazing
sun of the desert would fall to pieces when they
struck a sharp rock or were driven over a rough
incline. Families were obliged to join company
and throw away everything that tended to impede
their speed.</p>

<p>The approaching storms of autumn, which meant
impassable snow, would not allow them to linger.
In addition to this there were grizzlies in the mountains
and the constant fear of attack from Indians.
Such pioneers as strayed from the main company
were likely to fall in with an enemy that was continually
hovering on either flank of the march,
ready to swoop down upon unprotected men or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
women. This fear added to the speed of the journey,
and as they progressed the road over which
they traveled was strewn with dead or worn-out
cattle, abandoned wagons, discarded cooking utensils,
yokes, harness, chests, log chains, and all kinds
of family heirlooms that the settlers had hoped
to carry to their new homes. Sometimes the teams
grew so much weakened that none dared to ride
in the wagons, and men, women, and children would
walk beside them, ready to give a helping push
up any steep part of the road. A pioneer who
had once made this journey said, referring to a former
trip across the mountains, "The fierce summer's
heat beat upon this slow west-rolling column. The
herbage was dry and crisp, the rivulets had become
but lines in the burning sand; the sun glared from
a sky of brass; the stony mountainsides glared
with the garnered heat of a cloudless summer. The
dusky brambles of the scraggy sage-brush seemed
to catch the fiery rays of heat and shiver them
into choking dust, that rose like a tormenting
plague and hung like a demon of destruction over
the panting oxen and thirsty people.</p>

<p>"Thus day after day, for weeks and months,
the slow but urgent retreat continued, each day
demanding fresh sacrifices. An ox or a horse
would fall, brave men would lift the useless yoke
from his limp and lifeless neck in silence. If there
was another to take his place he was brought from
the loose band, yoked up and the journey resumed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
When the stock of oxen became exhausted, cows
were brought under the yoke, other wagons left,
and the lessening store once more inspected; if
possible another pound would be dispensed with.</p>

<p>"Deeper and deeper into the flinty mountains
the forlorn mass drives its weary way. Each morning
the weakened team has to commence a struggle
with yet greater difficulties. It is plain the journey
will not be completed within the anticipated time,
and the dread of hunger joins the ranks of the
tormentors.... The Indians hover in the
rear, impatiently waiting for the train to move
on that the abandoned trinkets may be gathered
up. Whether these are gathering strength for a
general attack we cannot tell. There is but one
thing to do&mdash;press on. The retreat cannot hasten
into rout, for the distance to safety is too great.
Slower and slower is the daily progress."</p>

<p>Marcus Whitman, however, had known these
difficulties before, and guarded his caravan from
many of them.</p>

<p>Up to that date almost no man had crossed
into Oregon by the route he was taking. A few
missionaries had made the journey on horseback,
driving some head of cattle with them, and three or
four wagons drawn by oxen had reached the Snake
River at an earlier date, but it was the general
opinion of trappers that no large company of people
could travel down the Snake River because of
the scarcity of pasturage and the rugged road<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
through the mountains. It was also thought that
the Sioux Indians would oppose the approach of
such a large caravan because the emigrants might
kill or drive away the buffaloes, which were already
diminishing in number and were hunted by this tribe
for food.</p>

<p>When they came to cross the Snake River Whitman
gave orders to fasten the wagons together in
one long line, the strongest ones being placed in the
lead. When the teams were in position Whitman
tied a long rope about his waist and fastened the
other end to the first team. Riding his horse into
the current he swam across the river. He called
to the other riders to follow him, and at the same
time to pull on the rope that was tied to the first
team. In this way the leaders were started into
the water, and all were drawn over in safety. At
times, however, it took a great deal of pulling on
the ropes by many men to drag the weaker teams
to a safe foothold on the farther bank. The Snake
River at the place where Whitman forded it was
divided into three separate rivers by islands, and as
the last stream on the Oregon shore was a deep and
rapid current fully a mile wide, it can be seen
what a task it was to get so many wagons, tired
ox-teams, and the great company of men, women
and children across it. But Whitman had solved
many such problems before. When he and his
wife went to Oregon six years earlier she had said it
was a shame that her husband should wear himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
out in getting their wagon through. "Yesterday,"
she said, "it was overset in the river and he was
wet from head to foot getting it out; to-day it
was upset on the mountainside, and it was hard
work to save it."</p>

<p>There were over a thousand people in this expedition
that was going out to colonize Oregon for the
United States. They had about one hundred and
twenty wagons drawn by ox-teams, which averaged
six yoke of oxen to a team, and, in addition, several
thousand horses and cattle, led or driven by the
emigrants. Although they started to travel in one
body they soon found they could do better by dividing
into two columns, marching within easy hailing
distance of each other, so long as they were in
danger of attack by the Indians, and later separating
into small parties, better suited to the narrow mountain
paths and the meagre pasture lands.</p>

<p>It is interesting to learn how such a company
traveled. At four o'clock in the morning the sentinels
who were on guard waked the camp by shots
from their rifles, the emigrants crept from their
canvas-covered wagons or tents built against the
side of the wagons, and soon the smoke of camp-fires
began to rise in the air. Sixty men, whose duty it
was to look after the cattle, would start out from the
corral, or enclosed space, spreading through the
horses and cattle, who had found pasturage over
night in a great semicircle about the camp. The
most distant animals were sometimes two miles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
away. These sixty scouts looked for Indian trails
beyond the herd and tried to discover whether any
of the animals had been stolen or had strayed during
the night. If none were lost the herders drove
the animals close to the camp, and by five o'clock
horses, oxen, and cattle were rounded up, and the
separate emigrants chose their teams and drove
them into the corral to be yoked. The corral was a
circle about one hundred yards deep, formed by
wagons fastened together by ox-chains, making a
barrier that could not be broken by any vicious ox
or horse, and a fortification in case of an attack by
Indians.</p>

<p>The camp was very busy from six to seven o'clock;
the women prepared breakfast; the tents were
packed away, the wagons loaded and the oxen
yoked and fastened to their owners' wagons. Each
of the two divisions had about sixty wagons, and
these were separated into sixteen platoons. Each
platoon took its turn at leading, and in this way none
of the wagons had to travel continually in the dust.
By seven o'clock the corral was broken up; the
women and children had found their places in the
wagons, and the leader, or pilot as he was called,
mounted his horse and was ready to lead the way
for the day's journey. A band of young men who
were not needed at the wagons, well mounted and
armed, would start on a buffalo hunt, keeping within
easy reach of the caravan and hoping to bring back
food for the night's encampment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
At seven o'clock the trumpet sounded the advance,
and the wagon that was to lead for that day slowly
rolled out of the camp and headed the line of march.
The other wagons fell in behind it, and guided by
the horsemen, the long line commenced its winding
route through the mountains.</p>

<p>The country through which Whitman had chosen
to travel was beautiful in the extreme; at times the
road lay through the great heights of the Rockies,
with a panorama of wonderful charm stretched on
the horizon; at times it lay beside broad rivers
where the clearness of the air brought out all the
colors of late summer foliage. The party of hunters
were also scouts for the caravan, searching the rivers
for the most promising fords. Having found one
to their liking, they would signal with a flag to the
pilot and his guides to show in which direction to
lead the wagons. These guides kept constantly on
the alert, for it would be hard if they had to march a
mile or two out of their way or retrace their steps
because of wrong advice. The rest of the emigrants
trusted the route entirely to their leaders and rode or
marched stolidly along, occasionally stopping to
gather a few flowers for the women and children in
the wagons. At noon the whole line stopped for
dinner. The scouting party would carefully choose
a good camping place, looking especially for the
grass and water that were so much needed at the end
of five hours of hard traveling. The teams were not
unyoked, but only turned loose from their wagons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
and the latter were drawn up in columns, four
abreast. No corral was formed, as there was little
danger from Indians or risk of animals straying in
the daytime.</p>

<p>At this noon rest many matters were discussed by
the caravan leaders. Whitman and one or two
others had been chosen to decide disputes between
the different members of the party. Orders for the
good of the caravan would be given out at this time,
and Dr. Whitman would visit any who were sick
and advise with the various families as to new difficulties
they had met with.</p>

<p>When dinner was eaten and the teams rested the
march was resumed, and continued until sundown,
when the scouts picked out the best camping place
for the night. The wagons were driven into a great
circle, fastened each to each, and the cattle freed to
seek a pasture; tents were pitched, fires started, and
all hands were busy. The scene was almost like a
small frontier town.</p>

<p>The caravan was divided into three companies,
and each of the companies subdivided into four
watches. Each company had the duty of acting as
sentries for the camp every third night, and each
watch took its turn. The first watch was set at eight
o'clock in the evening, just after the evening meal.
For a short time there would be talking, perhaps
singing, or the music of the violin or flute. Usually,
however, the day's traveling had been hard and trying,
and at an early hour the emigrants went to sleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
Late in the summer of 1843 Whitman's pioneers
left the mountains behind them, and came down into
the valleys watered by the tributaries of the Columbia
River. As they approached the missionary settlement
at Wai-i-lat-pui a band of Cayuse and Nez
Percés Indians came to meet them, bringing pack-mules
loaded with supplies. Few messengers could
have been more welcome. They told Whitman that
his wife and friends were still at the little clearing
where he had left them almost a year before, and
were eagerly looking forward to the arrival of the
new settlers. The leader thought that the caravan
could finish its journey without him now, so he
chose one of his most reliable Indian guides, Istikus,
and placed him in charge of the company. Whitman
himself hurried on to the mission. Back of him
rolled the long train of canvas-covered wagons that
had traveled so far over prairies, rivers, and mountains.
Almost a thousand men, women, and children
were coming into this far western section of the
continent to settle and hold the country for the
United States.</p>

<p>Whitman's ride changed the situation. No more
statesmen could speak of the impassable mountains
or the impossibility of taking settlers' wagons into
Oregon. Before Whitman left Washington Daniel
Webster sent a message to England stating that the
United States would insist on holding all territory
south of the forty-ninth degree of latitude. When
President Tyler was told that a caravan of nearly a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
thousand people under Whitman's leadership had
started for Oregon, a second and more positive
message to the same effect was sent to England.
All over the United States men were now demanding
that their government should claim the country
as far as the Pacific coast, and one great political
party took as its watchword the motto, "Oregon,
fifty-four, forty,&mdash;or fight," referring to the degree
of latitude they wanted for the boundary line. The
Hudson's Bay Company, finding so large a colony
of pioneers settling among them, was forced to give
over its efforts to hold the northwest entirely for
itself. In time the English statesmen agreed to the
claims of the United States, and on July 17, 1846, a
treaty was signed, fixing the boundary between
Canada and the United States at the forty-ninth
degree, which gave Oregon to the Republic.</p>

<p>The settlers prospered, and the little missionary
colony near the Walla Walla River grew in size.
Whitman resumed his work among the Indians, and
seemed to win their friendship. There seemed no
reason why the native tribes and their white friends
should not live in peace in such an undeveloped
country. After a time, however, fear or greed or
false leaders stirred up certain Indians and sent
them on the war-path against their friends. No one
knew the real cause for the outburst, but on November
29, 1847, a band of the Cayuse crept down on
the little cluster of houses at Wai-i-lat-pui and killed
fourteen of the white settlers. Marcus Whitman was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
one of the first to fall. He was in his house, with
several Indians as usual in the room with him. One
was sitting close to him, asking for some medicine,
when another came up behind and struck him with
a tomahawk. These two then gave the signal, and
their allies in other houses fell upon the white men
and women. After the massacre forty men, women,
and children were carried away from the valley by
the Indians, but most of them were later rescued
by the Hudson's Bay Company and sent back to
their homes. Other white settlers joined forces and
marched against the treacherous Cayuse, but the
latter fled through the country, scattering into different
tribes, and the leaders of the attack were not
captured until nearly two years later.</p>

<p>Daniel Webster had said in the Senate: "What
do we want with the vast, worthless area, this region
of savages and wild beasts, of deserts, of shifting
sands and whirlwinds of dust, of cactus and prairie
dogs? To what use could we ever hope to put these
great deserts, or these endless mountain ranges, impenetrable,
and covered to their base with eternal
snow? What can we ever hope to do with the
western coast, a coast of three thousand miles, rock-bound,
cheerless, and uninviting, and not a harbor
on it? What use have we for such a country?"
But though many great statesmen agreed with Webster
a simple missionary who had been to Oregon
looked into the future, saw the value of the vast
expanse, and had the courage and determination to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
ride across the continent for aid, and then bring
back a thousand settlers to help him realize his
dream. Marcus Whitman is one of the noblest examples
of that great type of pioneers who won the
western country for the United States.</p>

<br />
<span class="larger">HOW THE MORMONS CAME TO SETTLE UTAH</span></h2>

<p>In the winter of 1838-39 a large number of people
moved into the country on the east bank of the
Mississippi River in the state of Illinois. They had
taken the name of "Latter-Day Saints," but were
generally called Mormons, and were followers of a
new religion that had been founded by a man named
Joseph Smith a few years earlier. This strange new
religion had attracted many people to it, and the
greater number of them had first moved to Ohio, and
then into the new state of Missouri, but they were
not well received by the people of either of those
states, and had finally been driven from Missouri at
the point of the sword. Fortunately for them there
was plenty of unoccupied land in the West, and
their leader decided to take refuge near the town of
Quincy in Illinois. At that time a man had only to
reside in the state for six months in order to cast a
vote for president, and as an election was near at
hand the politicians of Illinois were glad to welcome
the Mormons. Looking about, the newcomers
found two "paper" cities, or places that had been
mapped out on paper with streets and houses, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
had never actually been built. The Mormon leaders
bought two large farms in the "paper" town of
Commerce, and many thousand acres in the country
adjoining, and there they laid out their new city, to
which they gave the strange name of Nauvoo.</p>

<p>The Mormon city lay along the Mississippi River,
and its streets and public buildings were planned on
a large scale. People flocked to the place, and as
the Mormon missionaries were eager workers the
number of converts grew rapidly. A temple was
built, which a stranger who saw it in 1843 said was
the wonder of the world. Many Mormon emigrants
came from England, usually by ship to New Orleans,
and thence by river steamboat up the Mississippi to
Nauvoo. By the end of 1844 at least fifteen thousand
people had settled there, and as many more
were scattered through the country in the immediate
neighborhood. Nauvoo was the largest city
in Illinois, and its only rival in that part of the West
was St. Louis. Joseph Smith had obtained a charter,
and both the political parties, the Whigs and
the Democrats, were doing their best to make friends
of his people. Nauvoo had little of the rough look
of most newly-settled frontier towns, and handsome
houses and public buildings sprang up rapidly along
its fine wide streets.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 569px;">
  <img id="ip_166" src="images/illo_174.jpg" width="569" height="370" alt="" /><br />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Nauvoo Had Handsome Houses and Public Buildings</span>
</div></div>

<p>Unfortunately for the Mormons their leader was a
man who made enemies as easily as he made friends.
He had aroused much ill feeling when he lived in
Missouri. As a result, when, one day in May, 1842,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
Governor Boggs of Missouri was shot and seriously
wounded while sitting at the window of his home,
many people laid the crime to Smith or his followers,
and believed that the prophet himself, as Smith was
called, had ordered the shooting. The officers of
Missouri asked the governor of Illinois to hand
Smith over to them. This was not done, and consequently
ill feeling against the prophet grew stronger.
In the meantime a man named John C. Bennett, who
had joined the Mormons at Nauvoo, and had been
the first mayor of the city, deserted the church, and
turned into one of the most bitter of its enemies.
He denounced the Mormons in letters he wrote to
the newspapers, and exposed what he called their
secrets. This led other people to attack the ideas
of the Mormons, and it was not long before there
was almost as much dislike of them in Illinois as
there had been in Missouri.</p>

<p>Even in the Mormon church itself there were men
who would not agree with all the prophet Joseph
Smith said. A few of these men set up a printing-press
and published a paper that they called the
<i class="publication">Nauvoo Expositor</i>. Only one issue of this sheet appeared,
dated June 7, 1844. That was enough, however,
to raise the wrath of Joseph Smith and his
elders, and they ordered the city marshal to destroy
the press. The marshal broke the press and type in
the main street of the city, and burned the contents
of the newspaper office.</p>

<p>The editors hastily fled to the neighboring town<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
of Carthage. The people there and in all the
neighboring villages denounced the destruction of
the press, and declared that the time had come to
force the Mormons to obey the laws, and, if they
would not do so, to drive them out of Illinois.
Military companies were formed, cannon were sent
for, and the governor of the state was asked to call
out the militia.</p>

<p>The governor went to the scene of the trouble to
investigate. He found all that part of the east shore
of the Mississippi divided between the Mormons and
their enemies. He ordered the mayor of Nauvoo to
send Mormons to him to explain why they had
destroyed the printing-press, and when he had heard
their story the governor told them that Smith and his
elders must surrender to him, or the whole military
force of the state would be called out to capture
them. But the prophet had not been idle. He had
put his city under martial law, had formed what was
called the Legion of the Mormons, and had called in
his followers from the near-by villages. He had
meant to defend his new city; but when he heard the
governor's threat to arrest him, he left Nauvoo with
a few comrades and started for the Rocky Mountains.
Friends went after him, and begged him not to
desert his people. He could not resist their appeal
to him to return, and he went back, although he was
afraid of the temper of his enemies. As soon as he
returned to Illinois he was arrested on the charge of
treason and of putting Nauvoo under martial law,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
and together with his brother Hyrum was sent to the
jail at Carthage.</p>

<p>Some seventeen hundred men, members of the
militia, had gathered at the towns of Carthage and
Warsaw, and the enemies of the Mormons urged the
governor to march at the head of these troops to
Nauvoo. He knew that in the excited state of affairs
there was danger that if these troops entered
the city they might set it on fire and destroy much
property. He therefore ordered all except three
companies to disband; with one company he set out
to visit the Mormon city, and the other two companies
he left to guard the jail at Carthage.</p>

<p>The governor marched to Nauvoo, spoke to the
citizens, and, having assured them that he meant no
harm to their church, left about sundown on his road
back to Carthage. In the meantime, however,
events had been happening in the latter place that
were to affect the whole history of the Mormons.</p>

<p>The two Smiths, Joseph and Hyrum, with two
friends, Willard Richards and John Taylor, were
sitting in a large room in the Carthage jail when a
number of men, their faces blackened in disguise,
came running up the stairway. The door of the
room had no lock or bolt, and, as the men inside
feared some attack, Hyrum Smith and Richards
leaped to the door and shutting it stood with their
shoulders against it. The men outside could not
force the door open, and began to shoot through it.
The two men at the door were driven back, and on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
the second volley of shot Hyrum Smith was killed.
As his brother fell the prophet seized a six shooting
revolver that one of their visitors had left on the
table, and going to the door opened it a few inches.
He snapped each barrel at the men on the stair;
three barrels missed fire, but each of the three that
exploded wounded a man. As the prophet fired
Taylor and Richards stood close beside him, each
armed with a hickory cane. When Joseph Smith
stopped shooting the enemy fired another volley
into the room. Taylor tried to strike down some of
the guns that were leveled through the broken door.</p>

<p>"That's right, Brother Taylor, parry them off as
well as you can!" cried Joseph Smith. He ran to
the window, intending to leap out, but as he jumped
two bullets fired through the doorway struck him,
and also another aimed from outside the building. As
soon as the mob saw that the prophet was killed
they scattered, alarmed at what had been done.</p>

<p>The people of Carthage and the neighboring
country expected that the Legion of the Mormons
would immediately march on them and destroy them.
Families fled in wagons, on horseback, and on foot.
Most of the people of the near-by town of Warsaw
crossed the Mississippi in order to put the river between
them and their enemies. In this state of
excitement the governor did not know which party
to trust, so he rode to the town of Quincy, forty
miles away, and at a safe distance from the scene of
trouble. But the Mormons made no attempt to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
avenge the death of their leader; they intended to let
the law look after that.</p>

<p>Week by week, however, it grew harder for them
to live on friendly terms with the other people of
Western Illinois, and more and more troubles arose
to sow distrust. The Gentiles, as those who were
not Mormons were called, began to charge the
Mormons with stealing their horses and cattle, and
the state repealed the charter that had been granted
to the city of Nauvoo.</p>

<p>During that summer of 1845, the troubles of
Nauvoo's people increased. One night in September
a meeting of Gentiles at the town of Green Plains
was fired on, and many laid the attack to the
Mormons. Whether this was true or not, their
enemies gathered in force and scoured the country,
burning the houses, barns, and crops of the Latter-Day
Saints, and driving them from the country behind
the walls of Nauvoo. From their city streets
the saints rode out to pay their enemies in kind, and
so the warfare went on until the governor appointed
officers to try to settle the feud. The people, however,
wanted the matter settled in only one way.
They insisted that the Mormons must leave Illinois.
In reply word came from Nauvoo that the Saints
would go in the spring, provided that they were not
molested, and that the Gentiles would help them to
sell or rent their houses and farms, and give them
oxen, horses, wagons, dry-goods, and cash in exchange
for their property. The Gentile neighbors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
would not promise to buy the goods the Mormons had
for sale, but promised not to interfere with their selling
whatever they could. At last the trouble seemed
settled. Brigham Young, the new leader of the
Mormons, said that the whole church would start
for some place beyond the Rocky Mountains in the
spring, if they could sell enough goods to make the
journey there. So the people of Nauvoo prepared
to abandon the buildings of their new flourishing city
on the Mississippi, and spent the winter trading their
houses for flour, sugar, seeds, tents, wagons, horses,
cattle, and whatever else might be needed for the
long trip across the plains.</p>

<p>The Mormons now looked forward eagerly to
their march to a new home, and many of them
traveled through the near-by states, buying horses
and mules, and more went to the large towns in the
neighborhood to work as laborers and so add to the
funds for their journey. The leaders announced
that a company of young men would start west in
March, and choose a good situation for their new
city. There they would build houses, and plant
crops which should be ready when the rest of the
Mormons arrived. But they knew there was always
a chance that the people of the country would attack
them, and therefore they sent messengers to the
governors of the territories they would cross, asking
for protection on the march. On February 10th
Brigham Young and a few other men crossed the
Mississippi and selected a spot on Sugar Creek as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
the first camp for the people who were to follow.
Young and the twelve elders of the Mormons
traveled together, and wherever their camp was
pitched that place was given the name of "Camp of
Israel."</p>

<p>The emigrants had a test of hardship even when
they first moved across the Mississippi. The temperature
dropped to twenty degrees below zero, and
the canvas-covered wagons and tents were a poor
shelter from the snow-storms for women and children
who had been used to the comforts of a large town.
Many crossed the Mississippi on ice. When they were
gathered on Sugar Creek Brigham Young spoke to
them from a wagon. He told them of the perils of
the journey, and then called for a show of hands by
those who were willing to start upon it; every hand
was raised. On March 1st the camp was broken
up, and the long western march began. The Mormons
were divided into companies of fifty or sixty
wagons, and every night the cattle were carefully
rounded up and guards set to protect them from attack.
From time to time they built more elaborate
camps, and men were left in charge to plant grain,
build log cabins, dig wells, and fence the farms, in order
that they might give food and shelter to other
Mormons who would be making the journey later.
The weather was all against their progress. Until
May it was bitter cold, and there were heavy snow-storms,
constant rains, sleet, and thick mud to be
fought with, but like many other bands of American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
pioneers the Mormons pushed resolutely on, some
days marching one mile, some days six, until May
16th, when they reached a charming spot on a
branch of the Grand River, and built a camp that
they called "Mount Pisgah." Here they plowed
and planted several acres of land. While this camp
was being pitched, Brigham Young and some of the
other leaders went on to Council Bluffs and at a
place north of Omaha, now the town of Florence,
located the last permanent camp of the expedition.</p>

<p>The trail of the Mormons now stretched across all
the western country. At each of the camps men,
women, and children were living, resting and preparing
supplies to cover the next stage of their journey.
But in spite of the care with which the march
was planned those who left Nauvoo last suffered the
most. There was a great deal of sickness among
them, and owing to illness they were often forced
to stop for several days at some unprotected point
on the prairies. Twelve thousand people in all
shared that Mormon march.</p>

<p>The Gentiles in Illinois did not think that the Mormons
were leaving Nauvoo as rapidly as they should.
Every week from two to five hundred Mormon teams
crossed the ferry into Iowa, but the neighbors thought
that many meant to stay. Ill feeling against them
grew, and a meeting at Carthage called on people
to arm and drive out all Mormons who remained
by mid-June. Six hundred men armed, ready to
march against Nauvoo.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
When the Mormons first announced that they
meant to leave their prosperous city in Illinois men
came hurrying from other parts of the country to
pick up bargains in houses and farms that they
thought they would find there. Many of these new
citizens were as much alarmed at the threats of the
neighbors as were the Mormons themselves; some of
them armed, and asked the governor to send them
aid. The men at Carthage grew very much excited,
and started to march on Nauvoo. Word came,
however, that the sheriff, with five hundred men, had
entered the city, prepared to defend it, and the
Gentile army retreated. A few weeks afterward the
hostilities broke out again, and seven hundred men
with cannon took the road to the city.</p>

<p>Those of the Mormons who were left, a few hundreds
in number, had built rude breastworks for
protection; some of the Gentile army took these,
and the rest marched through the corn fields, and
entered the city on another side. A battle followed
between the Gentiles in the streets and the Mormons
in their houses, and lasted an hour before the
Gentiles withdrew to their camp in the corn fields.</p>

<p>Peaceful citizens now tried to settle the matter.
They arranged that all the Mormons should
leave immediately, and promised to try to protect
them from any further attacks. So matters stood
until May 17th, when the sheriff and his men
marched into the city, and found the last of the Mormons
waiting to leave by the ferry. The next day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
they were told to go at once, and to make sure that
they did bands of armed men went through the
streets, broke into houses, threw what goods were
left out of doors and windows, and actually threatened
to shoot the people. The few remaining Saints,
most of them those who had been too ill to take up
the march earlier, were now thoroughly frightened,
and before sundown the last one of them had fled
across the Mississippi. A few days later this last
party, six hundred and forty in number, began the
long wearisome journey to the far west, and the
empty city of Nauvoo was at last in the hands of the
Gentiles.</p>

<p>The object of the Mormons was to find a place
where they might be free to live according to their
own beliefs. So far they had been continually hunting
for what they called their own City of Zion. As
they spent that winter of 1846-47 in their camp near
Council Bluffs, they tried to decide where they would
be safest from persecution. The far west had few
settlements as yet, and they were free to take what
land they would, but the Mormons wanted a site on
which to lay the foundations of a city that should one
day be rich and prosperous. They decided to send
out a party of explorers, and in April, 1847, one
hundred and forty-three men, under command of
Brigham Young, with seventy-three wagons filled
with food and farm tools, left the headquarters to go
still farther west. They journeyed up the north fork
of the Platte River, and in the valleys found great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
herds of buffaloes, so many in number that they had
to drive them away before the wagons could pass.
Each day the bugle woke the camp about five
o'clock in the morning. At seven the journey began.
The wagons were driven two abreast by men
armed with muskets. They were always prepared
for attacks from Indians, but in the whole of their
long journey no red men ever disturbed them. Each
night the wagons were drawn up in a half-circle on
the river bank, and the cattle driven into this shelter.
At nine the bugle sent them all to bed. So they
made their way over the Uinta range to Emigration
Canyon. Down this canyon they moved, and presently
came to a terrace from which they saw wide
plains, watered by broad rivers, and ahead a great
lake filled with little islands. Three days later
the company camped on the plain by the bank of
one of the streams, and decided that this should be
the site of their new city. They held a meeting at
which they dedicated the land with religious ceremonies,
and at once set to work to lay off fields and
start plowing and planting. Some of them visited
the lake, which they called the Great Salt Lake, and
bathed in its buoyant waters. Day by day more of
the pioneers arrived, and by the end of August they
had chosen the site of their great temple, built log
cabins and adobe huts, and christened the place the
"City of the Great Salt Lake." This name was
later changed to Salt Lake City.</p>

<p>It took some time for this large body of emigrants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
to build their homes. Wood was scarce and had to
be hauled over bad roads by teams that were still
worn out by the long march, therefore many built
houses of adobe bricks, and as they did not know
how to use this clay the rains and frost caused many
of the walls to crumble, and when snow fell the people
stretched cloths under their roofs to protect themselves
from the dripping bricks. Many families
lived for months in their wagons. They would take
the top part from the wheels, and setting it on the
ground, divide it into small bedrooms. The furniture
was of the rudest sort; barrels or chests for
tables and chairs, and bunks built into the side of
the house for beds. But at last they were free from
their enemies in this distant country. Men in Ohio,
Missouri, and Illinois had hounded them from their
settlements, but in this far-off region they had no
neighbors except a few pioneer settlers, and wandering
bands of Indians, who were glad to trade with
them. A steady stream of converts to the Mormon
church followed that first trail across the plains. A
missionary sent to England brought many men and
women from that country to the city on the Great
Salt Lake. Brigham Young and the other leaders
encouraged their followers above all else to cultivate
the land. Most of the Mormons were farmers, and
what shops there were dealt only in the necessities
of life. Food was a matter of the first importance,
and they had to rely entirely upon their own efforts to
provide it. Every one was given a piece of land for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
his house, and most of them had their own farms in
the outlying country. When they were sure of their
food they began to build their temple and other
public buildings, and these, like their streets, were
all planned on the lines of a great future city. They
first called their territory Deseret, but later changed
it to the Indian name of Utah.</p>

<p>Salt Lake City, and the territory of Utah, of
which it was the chief settlement, might have remained
for years almost unknown to the rest of the
United States had not gold been discovered in California
in the winter of 1849. The news of untold
riches in the land that lay between Utah and the
Pacific Ocean brought thousands of fortune hunters
across the plains, and many of them traveled by way
of Salt Lake City. That rush of men brought trade
in its track and served to make the Mormons' capital
well known. The quest for gold opened up the
lands along the Pacific and helped to tie the far west
to the rest of the nation. Soon railroads began to
creep into the valleys beyond the Rocky Mountains,
and wherever they have gone they have brought
men closer together. But in Utah the Mormons
were the first settlers, and no one could come and
drive them out of their chosen land. At last they
had found a city entirely of their own. They had
not been allowed to live in Nauvoo, and so they
built a new capital. Like all founders of new religions
the Mormons had to weather many storms, but
after they had passed through cold, hunger, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
hardships of many kinds they came to their promised
land.</p>

<p>Such is the story of the founding of Salt Lake
City, the home of the Mormon people.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="VIII" id="VIII">VIII</a><br />
<br />
<span class="larger">THE GOLDEN DAYS OF 'FORTY-NINE</span></h2>

<p>In 1848 California was largely an unexplored region,
the home of certain old Spanish missions, with
a few seaport towns scattered along the coast. Some
pioneers from the East had settled inland after California
had been separated from Mexico, and were
ranching and farming. One of these pioneers, a
well-to-do man named John A. Sutter, had staked
out a considerable tract of land near the American
River. He built a fort or stockade as headquarters,
and made his plans to cultivate the tract. He had
a number of men working for him, building a sawmill
on the south branch of the American River,
about forty miles from his main house. These workmen
were in charge of James Wilson Marshall, who
intended to have a dry channel serve as the tail-race
for the mill, and was widening and deepening it by
loosening the earth. At night the water of the
stream was allowed to run through this channel, and
wash out the gravel and sand. One day early in
January, as Marshall was walking along the bank of
the race, he noticed some shining yellow flakes in
the soil. He thought these flakes might be gold,
and gathering some of the earth carefully washed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
and screened it. In this way he obtained what
looked like gold-dust. Early the next morning he
went back to the race, and after some searching
found a yellow scale larger than the others. He
showed this, together with those he had obtained
the day before, to some of the workmen, and they
helped him to gather about three ounces. Later in
the day Marshall went to his employer Sutter, who
was at the fort, and there the two men tested the
flakes as well as they were able, and reached the
conclusion that they were really gold-dust.</p>

<p>It was important to keep the discovery as quiet as
possible. Searching along the dry channel Sutter
and Marshall found more of the gold flakes. In
some places the yellow scales were very plentiful,
and seemed to promise that large quantities of the
valuable mineral could be found near at hand. It
was impossible, however, to keep the news from the
workmen who had helped in finding the flakes.
Before long the news spread, and in March, 1848,
two newspapers of California mentioned the discovery
on the south fork of the American River.</p>

<p>The country was so sparsely settled, and life so
primitive, that no great excitement was caused by
this news for some months. But in May a Mormon,
coming from the settlement of Coloma to San
Francisco, walked down the main street waving a
bottle filled with gold-dust and shouting "Gold!
Gold! Gold from the American River!"</p>

<p>His words, and the sight of the glittering bottle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
caused tremendous excitement in San Francisco, and
in the twinkling of an eye men took possession of
sailboats, sloops, launches, any kind of craft, and
started up the Sacramento River. Those who could
not get boats to take the quicker course hurried off
on horses or mules, in wagons or on foot. It was
like a fairy tale. The seaport town of San Francisco,
which had been well filled, was practically deserted
overnight. Shopkeepers closed their stores, families
hurried from their houses, and every class of people
pushed toward the American River. The roads that
led thither, which had usually been almost as empty
as the prairies, were now filled with a wildly rushing
throng. A man who had crossed the Strait of
Carquines in April was the only passenger on the
ferry, but when he returned two weeks later he found
two hundred wagons trying to drive on board the
ferry-boat.</p>

<p>Business on the coast came to a standstill. The
newspapers that had been started stopped publication.
The churches closed, and all the town officers
deserted their posts. As soon as a ship touched the
coast and the crew heard of the finding of gold they
deserted, and the captain and mates, seeing themselves
without a crew, usually dashed after the
others. Empty vessels lay at the docks. A large
ship belonging to the Hudson's Bay Company, which
had put into San Francisco harbor, was in charge of
the captain's wife, every one else having left for the
gold fields. Prices in all the country from San<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
Francisco to Los Angeles jumped prodigiously. If
men were to stay at their work they demanded and
received twice their former wages. Shovels and
spades sold for ten dollars apiece. They, and a few
other mining implements, were the only things still
manufactured. The cry of gold had turned men's
heads like the magic wand of some fairy.</p>

<p>Inland California presented a strange sight. The
roads that ran from San Francisco to Sutter's Fort
had formerly lain between prosperous farm lands, but
now the crops were going to waste, the houses were
empty, and the cattle free to wander through fields
of grain. Along the American River, on the other
hand, hills and valleys were filled with sheltering
tents, and huts built of brush and rocks thrown together
in a hurry. Men could not stop for comfort,
but worked all day on the river bank. There were
almost as many ways of searching for the gold as
there were men. Some tried to wash the sand and
gravel in pans; some used closely woven Indian
baskets; some used what were called cradles. The
cradle was a basket six or eight feet long, mounted
on rockers, and open at one end; at the other end
was a coarse screen sieve. Cleats were nailed across
the bottom of the cradle. One workman would dig
the gravel from the river bank, another carry it to
the sieve, a third pour water over it, and a fourth
rock the cradle The screen separated the stones
from the gravel, the water washed away the earth
and carried the heavier soil out of the cradle, thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
leaving the black sand filled with the gold. This
was later carried to a pan and dried in the sun.
The sand could then be blown away, and the gold
would be left.</p>

<p>Men knew that fortunes were to be found here.
On a creek a few miles below Coloma, seventeen
thousand dollars' worth of gold was taken from a
ditch three hundred feet long, four wide, and two
deep. Another small channel had yielded no less
than twelve thousand dollars. Many men already
had bags and bottles that held thousands of dollars'
worth of the precious mineral. One man, who had
been able to get fifty Indians to work for him as
washers, obtained sixteen thousand dollars from a
small creek in five weeks' time.</p>

<p>All this quickly changed the character of upper
California. Every man wanted to be a miner, and
no longer a cattleman or farmer, as before. It
looked as though the towns would shrivel up, because
of the tremendously high wages demanded by the
men who were needed there. Cooks in San
Francisco were paid three hundred dollars a month,
and all kinds of mechanics secured wages of fifteen
or twenty dollars a day. The forts found it impossible
to keep soldiers on duty. As soon as men were
paid off they rushed to the American River. Sailors
deserted as fast as they could, and the American
war-ships that came to anchor off Monterey did not
dare to allow a single man to land. Threats of
punishment or offers of reward had no influence over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
the sailors. They all felt certain they could make
fortunes in a month at the gold fields.</p>

<p>Soon men began to wonder whether they could
not duplicate in other places the discovery that
Marshall had made on Sutter's land. Wherever
there was a river or stream explorers began to dig.
They were well rewarded. Rich placers of gold
were found along the course of almost all the streams
that flowed to the Feather and San Joaquin Rivers.
Along the course of the Stanislaus and Toulumne
Rivers was another field for mining. By midsummer
of 1848 settlers in southern California were
pouring north in thousands, and by October at least
ten thousand men were washing and screening the
soil of river banks.</p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Wherever There Was a Stream, Explorers Began to Dig</span>
</div></div>

<p>The Pacific coast was very far away from the rest
of the United States in that day. News usually
traveled by ship, and sailors brought the report of
the discovery of gold to Honolulu, to Oregon City,
and to the ports at Victoria and Vancouver. Letters
carried the first tidings to the people in the East,
and by the middle of the summer Washington and
New York had learned what was happening in
California, and adventurers along the Atlantic coast
were beginning to turn their faces westward. The
letters often greatly exaggerated the truth. A New
York paper printed reports which stated that men
were picking gold out of the earth as easily as hogs
could root up groundnuts in a forest. One man,
who employed sixty Indians, was said to be making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
a dollar a minute. Small holes along the banks of
streams were stated to yield many pounds of gold.
But even allowing for much exaggeration it was
evident that men were making fortunes in that
country.</p>

<p>Colonel Mason, in charge at San Francisco, sent
Lieutenant Loeser with his report to Washington.
The lieutenant had to take a roundabout route. He
went from Monterey to Peru, from there to Panama,
across the Isthmus, took boat to Jamaica, and from
there he sailed to New Orleans. When he reached
the capital he delivered his message, and showed a
small tea chest which held three thousand dollars'
worth of gold in lumps and flakes. This chest was
placed on exhibition, and served to convince those
who saw it that California must possess more gold
than any other country yet discovered. President
Taylor announced the news in an official message.
He said that the mineral had been found in such
quantities as could hardly be believed, except on the
word of government officers in the field. During
the winter of 1848-49 thousands of men in the East
planned to start for this El Dorado as soon as they
could get their outfits together, and spring should
open the roads.</p>

<p>The overland route to the West was long and very
difficult. At that time, though the voyage by sea
was longer, it was easier for men who lived on the
Atlantic coast. They might sail around Cape Horn,
or to the Isthmus of Panama, or to Vera Cruz, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
in the two latter cases cross land, and hope to find
some ship in the western ocean that would take
them to San Francisco. Business men in the East
seized the opportunity to advertise tents, beds,
blankets, and all manner of camp equipment, as
well as pans, rockers, and every kind of implement
for washing gold from the gravel. The owners of
ships of every description, many of them unseaworthy,
fitted up their craft, and advertised them as
ready to sail for San Francisco. The ports of Boston,
Salem, Newburyport, New York, Baltimore, and New
Orleans were crowded with brigs and schooners
loading for the Pacific. A newspaper in New York
stated that ten thousand people would leave for the
gold country within a month.</p>

<p>All sorts of schemes were tried. Companies were
formed, each member of which paid one hundred
dollars or more to charter a ship to take them around
the Horn. Almost every town in the East had its
California Association, made up of adventurers who
wanted to make their fortunes rapidly. By the end
of January, 1849, eighty vessels had sailed by way
of Cape Horn, and many others were heading for
Vera Cruz, and for ports on the Isthmus of Panama.
The newspapers went on printing fabulous stories
of the discoveries. One had a letter stating that
lumps of gold weighing a pound had been found in
several places. Another printed a letter from a man
who said he would return in a few months with a
fortune of half a million dollars in gold. A miner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
was said to have arrived in Pittsburgh with eighty
thousand dollars in gold-dust that he had gathered
in a few weeks. Whenever men met they discussed
eagerly the one absorbing topic of the fortunes waiting
on the coast.</p>

<p>The adventurers who sailed around Cape Horn
had in most cases the easiest voyages. There were
plenty of veteran sea-captains ready to command the
ships. A Boston merchant organized "The Mining
and Trading Company," bought a full-rigged vessel,
sold places in it to one hundred and fifty men, and
sailed from Boston early in January, 1849. The first
place at which she touched was Tierra del Fuego,
and she reached Valparaiso late in April. There
she found two ships from Baltimore, and in two days
four more arrived from New York, and one from
Boston. July 6th she entered the Golden Gate of
San Francisco, and found it crowded with vessels
from every port. The ships were all deserted, and
within an hour all this ship's crew were on shore.
The town itself was filled with bustle and noise.
Gambling was practically the only business carried
on, and the stores were jammed with men paying
any price for outfits for the gold country. This
company chose a place on the Mokelumne River,
and hastened there, but they found it difficult to
work on a company basis. The men soon scattered
and drifted to other camps; some of them found
gold, others in time made their way east poorer
than when they came.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
Those who went by the Isthmus had many adventures.
Two hundred young men sailed to Vera
Cruz, and landed at that quaint old Mexican city.
There they were told that bands of robbers were
prowling all through the country, that their horses
would die of starvation in the mountains, and that
they would probably be killed, or lose themselves
on the wild trail. Fifty of them decided not to go
farther, and sailed back in a homeward-bound ship
to New York. Those who went on were attacked
by a mob at the town of Jalapa, and had to fight
their way through at the point of revolvers. In
several wild passes bandits tried to hold them up,
but the Easterners put them to flight and pushed on
their way. All through the country they found relics
and wreckage of the recent days when General Scott
had marched an army into Mexico.</p>

<p>There was more trouble at Mexico City. A religious
procession was passing along the plaza, and
the Americans did not fall upon their knees. The
crowd set upon them, and they had to form a square
for their protection, and hold the mob at bay until
Mexican officers came to their rescue. Only after
fighting a path through other towns and a long
march did they reach the seaport of San Blas. One
hundred and twenty of them took ship from there to
San Francisco. Thirty, however, had left the others
at Mexico City, thinking they could reach the sea-coast
more quickly by another route. The ship
they caught could get no farther than San Diego.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
From there they had to march on foot across a
blazing desert country. Their food gave out, and
they lived on lizards, birds, rattlesnakes, and even
buzzards, anything they could find. Worn and
almost starving they reached San Francisco, ten
months after they had left New York. Such adventures
were common to the American Argonauts
of 1849.</p>

<p>Those gold-seekers who went by the Isthmus of
Panama had to stop at the little settlement of Chagres,
where one hundred huts of bamboo stood on the
ruins of the old Spanish fort of San Lorenzo. The
natives, lazy and half-clad, gazed in astonishment at
the scores of men from the eastern United States,
who suddenly began to hurry through their town.
Here the gold-hunters bargained for river boats,
which were usually rude dugouts, with roofs made of
palmetto branches and leaves, and rowed by natives.
It was impossible with such rowers to make much
speed against the strong current of the Chagres
River. Three days were required to make the journey
to Gorgona, where the travelers usually landed.
At this place they had to bargain afresh for pack-mules
to carry them the twenty-four miles that lay
between Gorgona and Panama. Many men, who
could not find any mules left in the town, deserted
their baggage and started for the Pacific coast on
foot. The chances were that no ship would be waiting
for them there, and they would have to warm
their heels in idleness for days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
General Persifor F. Smith, who had been ordered
to take command of the United States troops at
San Francisco, was one of those who had to wait for
a ship at Panama. Here he heard reports that a
good deal of the new-found gold was being sent to
foreign countries. Some said that the British Consul
had forwarded fifteen thousand ounces of California
gold to England, and that more than nine million
francs' worth of the mineral had been received in the
South American ports of Lima and Valparaiso. As
a result hundreds of men from those ports were taking
ship to California. General Smith did not like the
idea of foreigners profiting by the discovery of gold
in California, and issued an order that only citizens
of the United States should be allowed to enter the
public lands where the diggings were located. When
the <i class="ship">California</i>, a steamship from New York, reached
Panama in January, 1849, with seventy-five Peruvians
on board, General Smith warned them that
they would not be allowed to go to the mines, and
sent word of this order to consuls along the Pacific
coast of South America. In spite of his efforts, however,
foreigners would go to Upper California, and
the American prospectors were too busy with their
own searches to prevent the strangers from taking
what gold they could find.</p>

<p>When the <i class="ship">California</i> arrived at Panama she was
already well filled with passengers, but there were
so many men waiting for her that the captain had
to give in to their demands, and crowd his vessel with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
several hundred more gold-seekers. Loaded with
impatient voyagers, the steamship sailed up the
coast, and reached San Francisco about the end of
February. Immediately every one on board, except
the captain, the mate, and the purser, deserted the
ship, and dashed for the gold fields. The next
steamer to reach Panama, the <i class="ship">Oregon</i>, found an even
larger crowd waiting at that port. She took more
passengers on board than she was intended to carry,
but fortune favored the gold-seekers, and the <i class="ship">Oregon</i>,
like the <i class="ship">California</i>, discharged her adventurous cargo
in safety at San Francisco. Hundreds of others who
could not board either of these steamers ventured on
the Pacific in small sailing vessels, or any manner of
ship that would put out from Panama bound north.</p>

<p>It is interesting to know the story of some of these
pilgrimages. One of the Argonauts has told how he
organized, in a little New England town, a company
of twenty men. Each man subscribed a certain sum
of money in return for a share in any profits, and in
this way ten thousand dollars was raised. The men
who were to go on the expedition signed a paper
agreeing to work at least two years in the gold fields
for the company. The band went from the New
England town to New York, where they found the
harbor filled with ships that were advertised to sail
for Nicaragua, Vera Cruz, or Chagres. The leader
of the company chose a little brig bound for the latter
port, and in this the party, with some twenty-five
other passengers, set sail in March. They ran into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
a heavy storm, but in three weeks reached the port
on the Isthmus. There they had to wait some days,
as all the river boats had gone up to Gorgona.
When the boats were ready, thirty natives poled ten
dugouts up the river. When the men landed they
were told that there was no ship at Panama; that
half the gold-seekers in that town were ill, and that
there was no use in pushing on. So the party built
tents on the bank of the river, and stayed there until
the rainy season drove them to the coast. There
they camped again, and waited for a ship to arrive.
There was one vessel anchored in the harbor, but the
owner was under a bond to keep it there as a coal-ship.
The leader of the company, however, persuaded
the owner to forfeit this bond, and four hundred
waiting passengers paid two hundred dollars
apiece to be conveyed to California. The ship was
hardly seaworthy, and took seven weeks of sailing
and floating to reach the harbor of Acapulco. There
the vessel was greeted by a band of twenty Americans,
ragged and penniless, who had come on foot
from the City of Mexico. They had waited so long
for a ship that twenty of the passengers agreed to
give them their tickets, and take their places to wait
until the next vessel should arrive. It was almost
seven months after that New England party had left
New York before they arrived at the Golden Gate of
San Francisco.</p>

<p>There was very little choice between the Panama
and the Nicaragua routes to the West. Among those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
who tried the latter road were a number of young
men who had just graduated from Yale College.
They boarded a ship in New York that was advertised
to sail during the first week in February, and
expected to land in San Francisco in sixty days. It
was March, however, before the ship, crowded with
voyagers, set sail south from Sandy Hook. Three
weeks brought her to the mouth of the San Juan
River. The ship's company was landed at the
little tropical town of San Juan de Nicaragua.
A small steamboat had been brought along to
take them up the river, but when the machinery
was put together the boat was found to be
worthless. Like the voyagers by Panama, these
men then had to trust to native dugouts, and in this
way they finally got up the river to San Carlos.
Had it not been for their eagerness to reach California
such a trip would have been a delight to men
who had never seen the tropics before. The San
Juan River flowed through forests of strange and
beautiful trees. Tamarind and dyewood trees, tall
palms, and giant cacti, festooned with bright-colored
vines, made a background for the brilliant birds
that flew through the woods. Fruit was to be had
for the taking, and the weather at that time of the
year was delightful. But the thought of the fortunes
waiting to be picked up in California filled the minds
of most of the travelers.</p>

<p>After leaving the boats this party traveled by mule
to Leon. Nicaragua was in the midst of a revolution,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
and the Americans acted as a guard to the
President on the road to Leon. Near the end of
July the company separated. Some finally sailed
from the port of Realejo, and after many dangers
and a voyage of almost five months succeeded in
reaching San Francisco. Others reached Panama,
set sail in a small boat, and were never heard from
again; while yet a third party boarded a vessel at a
Nicaraguan port, and managed to reach California
after almost perishing from hunger and thirst.</p>

<p>Such were the adventures of some of those who
tried to reach the gold fields of the West by sea.
Hundreds of men made the trip by one of these
routes, and as soon as spring arrived thousands set
out overland. It was understood that large parties
would leave from western Missouri early in March,
and as a result many men, some alone, some in
bands of twenty or thirty, gathered there from all
parts of the East. Sometimes they formed military
companies, wore uniforms, and carried rifles. The
main place of gathering was the town of Independence,
which grew to the size of a large city in a few
weeks. Men came on foot and on horseback; some
with canvas-covered wagons, prairie schooners, and
pack-mules; some with herds of cattle; some bringing
with them all their household goods. All the
Middle West seemed to be in motion. In a single
week in March, 1849, hundreds of wagons drove
through Burlington, Iowa. Two hundred from
Memphis went along the Arkansas River, and hundreds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
more from Michigan, Wisconsin, Illinois, and
Pennsylvania crossed the border of Iowa.</p>

<p>The spring was late, and as the overland trip could
not be taken until the grass was high enough to feed
the cattle, the great company had to wait along the
frontiers from Independence to Council Bluffs. As
men gathered at these towns they would form into
companies, and then move on to a more distant
point, in order to make room for later arrivals.
Twenty thousand gathered along these frontiers before
the signal was given to start westward. The
march began about May 1st, and from then on, day
and night, scores of wagons crossed the Missouri
River, and the country looked like a field of tents.</p>

<p>From Independence most of the emigrants crossed
rolling prairies for fifteen days to the Platte River at
Grand Island. The route then wound up the valley
of the Platte to the South Fork, and from there to the
North Fork, where a rude post-office had been built,
at which letters might be left to be carried back east
by any travelers who were going in that direction.
From here the emigrants journeyed to the mountain
passes. They usually stopped at Laramie, which
was the farthest western fort of the United States.
By this time the long journey would be telling on
many of the companies, and the road be strewn with
all sorts of household goods, thrown away in order
to lighten the burden on the horses.</p>

<p>At the South Pass, midway of the Rocky Mountains,
two roads divided; those who took the southern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
road traveled by the Great Salt Lake to the Sierra
Nevada Mountains, and so into California. The
northern road lay partly along the course of the
Snake River to the headwaters of the Humboldt,
and from there the emigrants might choose a path
still farther to the north toward the Columbia River,
or westward to the Sacramento. Many went by the
trail along the Humboldt, although this route was
one of the most difficult. "The river had no current,"
said one of the gold-hunters. "No fish could
live in its waters, which wound through a desert, and
there was not enough wood in the whole valley to
make a snuff-box, nor vegetation enough on its banks
to shelter a rabbit. The stream flowed through
desert sands, which the summer heat made almost
unbearable for men and horses." Following its
course the travelers came to a lake of mud, surrounded
for miles by a sandy plain. Across this
they had to march for thirty-four hours to reach the
Carson River. Along the trail lay the bodies of
horses, mules, and oxen, and broken wagons parched
and dried out in the blazing sun.</p>

<p>The first of the overland travelers who crossed the
mountains late in the summer brought such reports
to the officers at the Pacific posts that the latter
decided that relief parties must be sent back to help
those who were still toiling in the desert. It was
known that some had been attacked by Indians, and
obliged to leave their covered wagons; that some
had lost all their cattle, and were almost without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
food. Therefore relief parties were hurried into the
mountains from the western side. They found the
overland trail crowded with men on foot and in
wagons. Many were sick, and almost all were
hungry. One man carried a child in his arms, while
a little boy trudged by his side, and his invalid wife
rode on a mule. The soldiers gave food to all who
needed it, and urged them to push on to the army
posts. Day after day they met the same stream of
emigrants, all bent on reaching the golden fields of
California.</p>

<p>Late in the autumn, with winter almost at hand,
the voyagers were still crossing the deserts and
mountains. The soldiers could not induce many
of them to throw away any of their goods. They
crept along slowly, their wagons loaded from baseboard
to roof. The teams, gradually exhausted,
began to fall, and progress was almost impossible.
Then the rescuers hurried the women to near-by
settlements, and forced the men to abandon some of
their baggage in an effort to reach shelter before the
winter storms should come. By the end of November
almost all the overland emigrants had crossed
the mountains.</p>

<p>The city of San Francisco had sprung up almost
overnight. In 1835 a Captain Richardson had
landed on the shore of Yerba Buena Cove, and
built a hut of four redwood posts, covered by a
sail. Five years afterward this village of Yerba
Buena contained about fifty people and a dozen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
houses. In 1846 the American war-ship <i class="ship">Portsmouth</i>
anchored there, and her captain raised the "Stars
and Stripes" on the Plaza. At that time there
were not more than fifty houses and two hundred
people. When the town became American the
Plaza was renamed Portsmouth Square, and a year
later the settlement was christened San Francisco.
That was in January, 1847; and by midsummer
of 1849 the town had become a city. It was an
odd place to look at. The houses were made of
rough unpainted boards, with cotton nailed across
the walls and ceiling in place of plaster; and many
a thriving business was carried on in canvas tents.
There were few homes. The city was crowded;
but most of the population did not intend to stay.
They came to buy what they needed, or sell what
they brought with them, and then hasten away
to the mines. So many eager strangers naturally
drove the prices up enormously, especially when it
seemed as though gold could be had for the taking.
The restaurants charged three dollars for a cup
of coffee, a slice of ham, and two eggs. Houses
and lots sold for from ten thousand to seventy-five
thousand dollars each, and everything else
was in proportion. What happened in San Francisco
also happened in many other California towns.
Sacramento was the result of the gold-craze. Speculators
bought large tracts of land in any attractive
place, gave it a high-sounding name, and sold city
lots. Many of these so-called cities, however, shriveled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
up within a year or two. The seaports flourished
because they were the gateways through
which the newcomers passed in their rush to locate
in the gold country.</p>

<p>These seaports became the goal of merchants
everywhere. Necessary articles were so scarce that
they were shipped long distances. Flour was
brought from Australia and Chili, rice and sugar
from China, and the cities along the Atlantic provided
the dry-goods, the tools, and the furniture.
At one time a cotton shirt would sell for forty
dollars, a tin pan for nine, and a candle for three.
But on the other hand cargoes of goods that were
not needed, silks and satins, costly house-furnishings,
were left on the beaches and finally sold for a
song.</p>

<p>From the seaports the new arrivals hurried either
up the Sacramento and the Feather Rivers to the
northern gold fields, or up the San Joaquin to the
southern country. Usually they were guided by
the latest story of a rich find, and went where
the chances seemed best. Several men would join
forces and pitch their tents together, naming their
camp Rat-trap Slide, Rough and Ready Camp,
Slap-jack Bar, Mad Mule Gulch, Git-up-and-Git,
You Bet, or any other name that struck their fancy.
There were no laws to govern these little settlements,
and the men adopted a rough system of
justice that suited themselves. But as the numbers
increased it was evident that California must have a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
better form of government, and steps were taken to
have that rich stretch of land along the Pacific
admitted as a state to the United States.</p>

<p>In three years California had grown from the
home of about two thousand people to the home
of eighty thousand. The finding of gold had
changed that almost unknown wilderness into a
thriving land in the twinkling of an eye. Railroads
were built to reach it, and more and more
men poured west. Some men made great fortunes,
but more in a few months abandoned their claims
and drifted to the cities, or made their way slowly
back to the eastern farms and villages from which
they had set out. The Forty-niners, as the gold-seekers
were called, found plenty of adventure in
California, even if they did not all find a short-cut to
wealth.</p>

<br />
<span class="larger">HOW THE UNITED STATES MADE FRIENDS WITH JAPAN</span></h2>

<p>One of the beautiful names that the Japanese
have given to their country is "Land of Great
Peace," and at no time was this name more appropriate
than in the middle of the nineteenth century.
Two hundred years before the last of the civil
wars of Japan had come to an end, and the people,
weary of years of bloodshed, had turned delightedly
to peaceful ways. The rice-fields were replanted,
artisans returned to their crafts, shops opened again,
and poets and painters followed the call of their
arts. The samurai, or warriors, sheathed their
swords, though they still regarded them as their
very souls. They hung their armor in their ancestral
halls, and spent their time in sport or idleness.
The daimios, or nobles of Japan, lived either
in the city of Yedo or at their country houses,
taking their ease, and gradually forgetting the arts
of war on which their power had been founded.
All the people were quite contented, and had no
desire to trade with the rest of the world. As a
matter of fact they knew almost nothing about
other countries, except through English or Russian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
sailors who occasionally landed on their coasts.
Japan was satisfied to be a hermit nation.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the seventh day of July,
1853, or the third day of the sixth month of Kayéi,
in the reign of the Emperor Koméi, the farmers
working in the muddy rice-fields near the village of
Uraga saw a strange sight. It was a clear summer
afternoon, and the beautiful mountain Fuji, its cone
wreathed in white clouds, could be seen from sea
and shore. What startled the men in the fields,
the people in the village, and the boatmen in the
harbor, was a fleet of vessels coming to anchor
in the bay of Yedo. These monsters, with their
sails furled, although they were heading against
the wind, were shooting tongues of smoke from
their great black throats. "See the fire-vessels!"
cried the Japanese to each other. When the peasants
asked the priests where the monsters came
from the wise men answered that they were the
fire-vessels of the barbarians who lived in the
West.</p>

<p>The monsters were four ships of the United States
navy, the <i class="ship">Mississippi</i>, <i class="ship">Susquehanna</i>, <i class="ship">Plymouth</i>, and
<i class="ship">Saratoga</i>, all under command of Commodore Matthew
Calbraith Perry. The fleet dropped anchor in
the wide bay, forming a line broadside to the shore.
The gun-ports were opened, and sentries set to
guard against attack by pirates, or by fire-junks.
As the anchors splashed in the water rockets shot
up from one of the forts on shore signaling to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
court at Yedo that the barbarians had reached
Japan.</p>

<p>The town of Uraga was usually not a very busy
place, and the government officers spent their time
drinking tea, smoking, and lounging in the sun, and
occasionally collecting custom duties from junks
bound to other harbors. But there was a great bustle
on the day the strange ships arrived. The chief
magistrate, or buniō, his interpreter, and suite of attendants,
put on their formal dress of hempen cloth,
and fastened their lacquered ornamented hats to their
heads; with two swords in each belt, the party
marched to the shore and boarded their state barge.
Twelve oarsmen rowed it to the nearest foreign ship,
but when they tried to fasten ropes to the vessel so
that they might go on board, the barbarians threw
off the ropes, and gestured to them to keep away.</p>

<p>The Japanese officer was surprised to find that,
although he was gorgeously robed, and his companions
carried spears and the Tokugawa trefoil flag,
the barbarians were not at all impressed. They told
him, through an interpreter, that their commander
wished to confer with the governor himself. The
officer answered that the governor was not allowed
to board foreign ships. After some further discussion
the surprised Japanese was permitted to climb
the gangway ladder and meet the barbarians on the
deck of their vessel.</p>

<p>Commodore Perry knew that the Japanese loved
mystery, high-sounding names, and ceremonies, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
so he stayed in his cabin and would not show himself
to the visitors. A secretary carried his messages,
and explained that the mysterious commodore had
come on a friendly mission and bore a letter from the
President of the United States to the Emperor of
Japan, which he wished to present with all proper
ceremony. He declined to go to Nagasaki, and insisted
that he should remain in Yedo Bay, and
added that although his visit was entirely friendly,
he would not allow any inquisitive sightseers to
prowl about his fleet. Very much impressed with
the power of this hidden barbarian, the Japanese
officer immediately ordered all the small boats, the
punts and sampans that had gathered about the
fleet, to row away.</p>

<p>The officer and his body-guard returned to shore,
and told the villagers that the visitors were very remarkable
men, who were not at all impressed by
their costumes or weapons. The Japanese had no
such title as commodore in their language, and they
referred to Perry as Admiral, and credited him with
almost as much majesty as their own hidden Mikado,
or as the mighty Shogun.</p>

<p>The western coast of Japan was much excited that
night. Rockets from the forts, and huge watch-fires
on the cliffs, told the whole country that a most unusual
event had happened. The peasants set out
their sacred images, and prayed to them as they had
not done in years. It was evident that the gods of
Japan were punishing the people for their neglect by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
sending these great fire-vessels to disturb the coast.
To add to the general excitement a wonderful light
appeared in the sky about midnight, spreading a
pale red and blue path across the heavens, as though
a dragon were flying through space. Priests and
soothsayers made the most of this display of Northern
Lights, and pointed out that the fire-vessels,
clearly revealed in the harbor, must have something
to do with the strange omen.</p>

<p>The governor of Uraga himself, with a retinue of
servants, all clad in embroidered gowns and lacquered
helmets, and each carrying two swords, went
out to the flag-ship next morning. He had evidently
overlooked the fact that the barbarians had been told
on the day before that the governor could not pay
such a visit to their fleet. The governor was used
to being received with a great deal of attention, and
to having people bow to the ground as he went by;
but on the deck of the <i class="ship">Susquehanna</i> the sailors
looked at him with simple curiosity, and when he
asked to speak with the mysterious admiral, he was
told that he would only be allowed to speak with the
captains. These men said that their commander
would only wait three days for an answer from Yedo
as to whether the Mikado would receive the letter of
the President. They showed him the magnificent
box that held the letter, and the governor's curiosity
grew even greater. When he left the flag-ship he
had promised to urge the Americans' cause.</p>

<p>Next day, the men dressed in silk and brocade,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
painted helmets, and gleaming sashes, eager to visit
the ships again, were surprised to learn that the barbarian
prince would transact no business. His interpreter
declared that it was a day of religious observance,
known as Sunday. The people on shore
heard the sailors of the fleet singing hymns, a strange
sound in those waters. Hastily the Japanese offered
new presents at the shrines of their own gods to ensure
protection from the barbarians.
8
By now the hermit people thought they might
have to guard themselves, and began to build earthworks
along the shore. Farmers, fishermen, shopkeepers,
women, and children were pressed into
service. Rude embankments were thrown up, and
enormously heavy brass cannon were placed at openings.
The old samurai, who had almost forgotten
warfare, sought out their weapons, and gathered
their troops. Their armor consisted of jackets of
silk, iron and paper. Their arms were old matchlocks
and spears. They could have fought each
other, but they were several hundred years behind
the barbarians in military matters. On the hills they
set up canvas tents, with flags bearing flaming
dragons and the other emblems of their clans. In
the days of their civil wars bright-colored trappings
had played an important part.</p>

<p>Yedo was then the chief city of Japan. When
Perry arrived in 1853 it was the home of the Shogun
Iyéyoshi, who was the real ruler of the land, although
the Mikado was called the sovereign. Yedo had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
been the home of a long line of Shoguns of the
Tokugawa family who had ruled the country, calling
themselves "Tycoons." They had built up the city,
and filled it with palaces and temples that had never
been equaled in magnificence. The people of Yedo,
numbering over a million, were greatly excited when
they heard of the fleet of war-ships lying in their
great bay. The Shogun, his courtiers and his warriors
bestirred themselves at once. Soldiers were
summoned, armor polished, swords unsheathed,
castles repaired, and everything possible done to
make an impression on the strangers.</p>

<p>The chief men knew that they could not oppose
this foreign admiral. Once they had had war-vessels
of their own, but years of peace had reduced
their navy, and they could not defend their coasts.
The Shogun was afraid that the admiral might insist
upon seeing the Mikado at Kiōto, and that would be
a great blow to his own dignity. After hours of
debate and discussion he chose two daimios to
receive the letter of the American President, Millard
Fillmore, and sent word to all coast towns to man
their forts.</p>

<p>Perry had played the game well, and so far had
allowed no Japanese to see him. He wanted to
make a treaty with Japan, and he knew that to succeed
he must impress this Oriental people with his
dignity. He allowed his captains and two daimios
to arrange a meeting to be held at a little town
called Kurihâma, near the port of Uraga. Each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
side had tried to outdo the other in politeness. The
American captains had received the Japanese officers
with great respect, had served them wines, and seated
them in upholstered armchairs. The Japanese
regretted that they could not provide their guests
with armchairs or with wine on shore, but the visitors
assured them that they would be willing to adopt
Japanese customs.</p>

<p>By July 13th the scene for the meeting was ready.
Hundreds of yards of canvas, with the Tokugawa
trefoil, had been stretched along the road to Kurihâma.
Hundreds of retainers, clad in all the colors of their
feudal days, were gathered about the tents, and on
the beach stood as many soldiers, glittering in their
lacquered armor. The American officers were almost
as brilliantly dressed as the Japanese. They
wore coats with a great many bright brass buttons,
and curious shaped hats cocked on their heads.
They brought musicians with them who played on
cornets and drums, and the music was quite unlike
anything the natives had ever heard before. Three
hundred of the barbarians landed and marched
from the beach to the main tent, while the eager-eyed
people lined the road and wondered at their strange
appearance.</p>

<p>Two or three big sailors carried the American
flag, and back of them came two boys with the
mysterious red box that had been shown to the
officers of the port. Back of them marched the
great commodore, clad in full uniform, and on either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
side of him strode a black man armed with a large
sabre. Many of the Japanese had never seen a white
man before, and still fewer had ever looked upon a
negro. They were therefore very much impressed
by the procession.</p>

<p>The officers of the Shogun received their magnificent
visitor at the door of the pavilion. After greetings
the two boys handed the box to the negro
guards, who opened the scarlet cloth envelope and the
gold-hinged rosewood cases, and laid the President's
letter on a lacquered stand brought from Yedo.
A receipt for the President's letter was then handed
to the commodore, who said that he would return to
Japan the next spring, probably in April or May.
The meeting lasted half an hour, and then, with the
same pomp and ceremony, the Americans returned
to their ships.</p>

<p>For eight days the fleet remained in the bay.
One party of sailors landed, but made no trouble,
and was actually so polite that the people offered
them refreshments of tea and fruit. At close range
the barbarians were not so terrifying as the natives
had thought them at first, and when they embarked
for their fleet the people urged them to come back
again. On July 17th the war-ships steamed away,
leaving the cliffs covered with people, who gazed in
astonishment at vessels that had no canvas spread,
but were driven entirely by fire.</p>

<p>Perry's object in visiting Japan was to obtain a
treaty that would allow trade relations between the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
United States and this hermit nation. He wanted to
give the Japanese people time to consider President
Fillmore's letter, and so he planned to keep his
squadron in Eastern waters until the following
spring, when he would return to learn the result of
his mission at Yedo. There was much of interest to
him in China, and he spent the autumn and part of
the winter making charts of that coast, and visiting
ports where American merchants were already
established.</p>

<p>Meantime the letter of the American President had
caused great excitement in Japan. Almost as soon
as Perry left a messenger was sent to the Shinto
priests at the shrines of Isé to offer prayers for the
peace of the empire, and to urge that the barbarians
be swept away. A week later the Shogun Iyéyoshi
died, and left the government at odds as to what to do.</p>

<p>Some of the daimios remembered the military
ardor of their ancestors, and wanted to fight the
barbarians, rather than make a treaty with them.
Others thought that it would be madness to oppose
an enemy who had such powerful ships that they
could capture all the Japanese junks, and destroy
the coast cities. One powerful nobleman declared
that it would be well for Japan to meet the barbarians,
and learn from them how to build ships and lead
armies, so that they would be able in time to defeat
them at their own arts. The Mikado had little to do
in the discussion. The actual ruler was the new
Shogun Iyésada, son of the former Shogun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
While Commodore Perry was cruising along the
coast of China he heard that French and Russian
merchants were planning to visit Japan. He was
afraid that his country might lose the benefits of his
visit unless he could obtain a treaty before these
other countries did. Therefore, although a midwinter
cruise to Japan was difficult and dangerous,
he determined to risk this and return at once.
Four ships set sail for Yedo Bay February 1, 1854,
and a week later the commodore followed with
three others.</p>

<p>In the city of Yedo the new Shogun was very busy
preparing either for peace or war. A long line of
forts was hurriedly built on the edge of the bay in
front of the city. Thousands of laborers were kept
at work there, a great number of cannon were cast,
and shops worked day and night turning out guns
and ammunition. An old law had directed that all
vessels of a certain size were to be burned, and only
small coasting junks built. This law was repealed,
and all the rich daimios hurriedly built war-ships.
These ships flew a flag representing a red sun on a
white background, and this later became the national
flag of Japan. A native who had learned artillery
from the Dutch was put in charge of the soldiers;
old mediæval methods of fighting were abandoned,
and artillery that was somewhat like that of European
countries was adopted.</p>

<p>In spite of all this bustle and preparation, however,
the Shogun and his advisers thought it would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
be wisest for them to agree to a treaty with the
United States. Therefore a notice was issued on
December 2, 1853, which stated that "owing to want
of military efficiency, the Americans would, on their
return, be dealt with peaceably." At the same time
the old practice of Fumi-yé, which consisted in
trampling on the cross and other emblems of Christianity,
and which had been long practiced in the
city of Nagasaki, was abolished.</p>

<p>Some men in the country were insisting that the
time had come for the Japanese to visit the West,
and learn the new arts and trades. One of these
was a scholar, Sakuma, who urged the government
to send Japanese youths to Europe to learn shipbuilding
and navigation. The Shogun did not approve
of this idea; but a pupil of the scholar, named
Yoshida Shoin, heard of it, and decided to go abroad
by himself. Sakuma gave him money for his expenses,
and advised him how he might get passage
on one of the American ships, when the fleet should
return to Japan.</p>

<p>As soon as the Shogun learned that Commodore
Perry was about to return he chose Hayâshi, the
chief professor of Chinese in the university, to serve
as interpreter. The Americans had used Chinese
scholars in their communications with the Japanese,
and Hayâshi was a man of great learning and courtly
manners. The Shogun also found a native who
understood English, although the Americans did
not know this. This man, Nakahama Manjiro, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
two companions, had been picked up at sea by an
American captain, and taken to the United States,
where he obtained a good education. He and his
two mates then decided that they would return to
their native land, and went to Hawaii, where they
built a whale-boat, and then sailed for the coast of
China on board an American merchantman. In
time the wanderers reached home, and when the
Shogun heard of Manjiro's travels he made him a
samurai, or wearer of two swords. The whale-boat
that he had built was used as a model for others,
and the traveler taught his friends some of the knowledge
of the Western people.</p>

<p>On February 11, 1854, the watchmen on the hills
of Idzu saw the American fleet approaching. Two
days later the great war-ships of the barbarians
steamed up the bay. The seven vessels dropped
anchor not far from Yokosŭka, and the captain of
the flag-ship received visits from the governor and
his interpreters. Again the same exaggerated forms
of politeness were observed, and presents of many
kinds, fruits, wines, and confectionery, were exchanged.
The Japanese suggested that Perry should
land and meet them at Kamakura or Uraga, but the
commodore replied, through his captain, that he
should stay where he was until the Japanese had
decided what they would do. He gave them until
February 21st to decide about the treaty.</p>

<p>Boats were sent out from the fleet daily to make
surveys of the bay, but none of the crews were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
allowed to land. At length the Japanese stated that
they were ready to treat with the American officers,
and Captain Adams was sent to Uraga to inspect
the place where the fleet was to anchor, and the new
building in which the treaty was to be signed. The
captain, with his aides, entered the hall of reception,
and was met by a daimio named Izawa. The daimio
was fond of joking. After many polite greetings
Captain Adams handed the nobleman a note from
Commodore Perry. Izawa took out his great spectacles,
but before he put them on he folded up his
large fan with a loud snap. The Americans, alarmed
at the noise, clapped their hands to their revolvers.
Izawa could not help laughing at their confusion,
but quickly adjusted his spectacles, and after reading
the note, said that he was much gratified at
the commodore's greeting. Rice and tea, cake and
oranges were served the guests. A long argument
followed. Captain Adams said that the building
was large enough for simple talking, but not for the
display of presents; and that Commodore Perry
would much rather go to the city of Yedo. The
Japanese answered that they much preferred that
the meeting should take place at Uraga or Kanagawa.
The debate, carried on through Chinese interpreters,
was a lengthy one.</p>

<p>Two days later the commodore moved his fleet
ten miles farther up the bay. From here his crews
could see the great temple-roofs, castles, and pagodas
of Yedo itself, and could hear the bells in the city<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
towers. This advance of the fleet convinced the
Shogun that Perry meant to go to Yedo. Some of
his court had thought that it would be a national
disgrace if the barbarians were permitted to enter
that city, but the government now decided to yield
the point, and suggested a place directly opposite,
at Yokohama, for the place of treaty.</p>

<p>No such scene had ever been witnessed in the
hermit land of Japan as the one that took place there
on the morning of March 8, 1854. The bay of Yedo
was covered with great state barges and junks with
many-colored sails. On shore were hundreds of
soldiers, the servants of the great daimios, dressed
in the gorgeous costumes of earlier centuries. Held
back by ropes were thousands of country people who
had gathered from all over that part of Japan to see
the strange men from the West. Everywhere was
color. Tents, banners, houses, and the costumes of
men, women and children blazed with it. The
American sailors in all their voyages in the East
had never seen such a brilliant picture.</p>

<p>Perry was not to be outdone. His men left the
ships to the noise of cannon that echoed and re-echoed
along the shore. Twenty-seven boats brought
five hundred men, and as soon as they landed
the marines formed a hollow square, while three
bands played martial music. The great commodore,
now looked upon by the Japanese with awe, embarked
from the <i class="ship">Powhatan</i> in his white gig; more
guns were fired; more flags waved; and with great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
pomp, Perry landed on the beach. His object was
to impress the hermit people with the dignity of his
nation.</p>

<p>A number of meetings followed before the treaty
was completed. The Americans insisted that vessels
in need of wood, coal, water, or provisions should be
allowed to get them from shore, and that the Japanese
should care for shipwrecked sailors. They
also wanted the two ports, Shimoda and Hakodate,
opened to them. The Japanese were willing, provided
they would not travel inland farther than they
could return the same day, and that no American
women should be brought into the country. But
when the Japanese objected to the arrival of women,
Commodore Perry threw back his cloak and exclaimed,
"Great heavens, if I were to permit any
such stipulation as that in the treaty, when I got
home the women would pull out all the hairs of my
head!" The Japanese were surprised at Perry's
excitement, thinking that they must have offended
him greatly. When the interpreters explained what
he had actually said, however, both sides laughed
and continued peacefully. They grew more and
more friendly as the meetings progressed. They
dined together and exchanged gifts. The Americans
liked the sugared fruits, candied nuts, crabs,
prawns, and fish that the Japanese served in
different forms, while the hermit people developed
a great fondness for the puddings and champagne
the Americans offered them. When it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
came to gifts, the eyes of the Japanese opened wide
at the many surprising things the barbarians had invented.
They were delighted with the rifles, the
clocks, the stoves, the sewing-machines, the model
of a steam locomotive, and the agricultural tools,
scales, maps, and charts that Perry had brought to
the Mikado. These presents were to open the
minds of the Japanese to the march of progress in
the rest of the world; and to teach them the uses of
steam and electricity, the printing-press, newspapers,
and all the other inventions that were products of
Europe and America.</p>

<p>In exchange, the art-loving people of Japan gave
their visitors beautiful works in bronze, lacquer,
porcelain, bamboo, ivory, silk, and paper, and great
swords, spears and shields, wonderfully inlaid and
decorated, that were handed down from their feudal
days.</p>

<p>While the fleet stayed Japanese spy-boats kept
watch in the bay, to see that their young men did
not board the foreign ships in their desire to see
something of the world. Time and again the young
Yoshida Shoin and a friend tried to break through the
blockade, but every time they were sent back to shore.
At last the two left Yedo for the port of Shimoda.</p>

<p>The Americans set up telegraph poles, and laid
rails to show the working of the model locomotive.
They gave an exhibition of the steam-engine. This
caused great excitement in the country near Yedo,
and every one who could went to see the strange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
performance. Already there was a struggle between
those who were eager to learn the inventions of the
Americans, and those who were afraid that the new
ideas would spoil old Japan. Many an ambitious
youth stared at the Mikado's presents, and tried to
learn more of their secrets from the sailors on their
way to or from the fleet.</p>

<p>The treaty was signed on March 31, 1854, and
agreed that shipwrecked sailors should be cared for,
provisions needed by ships should be obtained in the
ports, and American vessels allowed to anchor in the
two harbors of Shimoda and Hakodate. Actual trade
was not yet allowed, nor were Americans to be permitted
to reside in Japan. The hermit nation was
not at all eager to enter into competition with other
countries, nor to allow foreigners to trade with her.
Commodore Perry knew, however, that even the
slight terms he had gained would prove the beginning
of the opening up of Japan to the rest of the world.</p>

<p>April 18, 1854, Perry left the bay of Yedo for
Shimoda, and there the fleet stayed until early in
May. While the squadron was there two Americans,
who were botanizing on land, met the youth Yoshida
Shoin and his friend. The young Japanese gave the
Americans a letter, but seeing some native officers
approaching, he and his friend stole away. A few
nights later the watch on the war-ship <i class="ship">Mississippi</i>
heard voices calling, "Americans, Americans!"
They found the two Japanese youths in a small boat,
and took them on board. Paper and writing materials<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
were found hidden in their clothes, and they
explained that they wanted to go with the fleet to
America, and write down what they saw there. The
commodore, however, felt that he was in honor
bound to send the two young men back to their
homes; and did so. Yoshida later came to be one
of the leaders of the new Japan that ended the long
line of Shogun rulers, and made the Mikado the
actual emperor.</p>

<p>The fleet cruised from one port to another, now
well received by the people, who had forgotten their
fear of the barbarians' fire-vessels. The governors of
the different provinces gave presents to Perry, among
them blocks of native stone to be used in building
the great obelisk that was rising on the banks of the
Potomac River in memory of Washington. On July
17th the last of the squadron left Napa for Hong
Kong.</p>

<p>The Americans had shown the Japanese that they
were a friendly people, with no desire to harm them.
A race that had lived shut off from the rest of the
world for so many centuries was naturally timid and
fearful of strange people. From time to time European
ships had landed in Japan, and almost every
time the sailors had done injury to the natives.
Perry, however, convinced them that the United
States was a friend, and the treaty, slight though its
terms were, marked the dawn of a new era in Japan.
Like the sleeping princess, she woke at the touch of
a stranger from overseas.</p>

<span class="larger">THE PIG THAT ALMOST CAUSED A WAR</span></h2>

<p>Off the far northwestern corner of the United
States lie a number of small islands scattered along
the strait that separates the state of Washington
from Vancouver Island. One of these goes by the
name of San Juan Island, a green bit of land some
fifteen miles long and seven wide. The northern
end rises into hills, while the southern part is covered
with rich pastures. In the hills are coal and limestone,
and along the shore is splendid cod, halibut,
and salmon fishing. In the year 1859 a farmer
named Hubbs pastured his sheep at the southern
end of San Juan, and had for a neighbor to the
north a man in the employ of the English Hudson's
Bay Company, whose business it was to raise pigs.
The pigs throve on San Juan, and following their
fondness for adventure left Mr. Griffiths' farm and
overran the whole island. Day after day Hubbs
would find the pigs grubbing in his pasture, and
finally in a moment of anger he warned his neighbor
that he would kill the next pig that came on his
land. Griffiths heard the warning, but evidently the
pigs did not, for the very next day one of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
crossed the boundary line and ventured into Mr.
Hubbs' field. Here it began to enjoy itself in a
small vegetable patch that Mr. Hubbs had planted.
As soon as he saw the trespasser Hubbs went for his
gun, and returning with it, shot the intruding pig.</p>

<p>When Griffiths found his dead pig he was as angry
as Hubbs had been, and he immediately set out in
his sailboat and crossed the strait to Victoria, a little
city on Vancouver Island, where officers of the
British Government had their headquarters. He
stated his case, and obtained a warrant of arrest for
his neighbor Hubbs. Then he sailed back to San
Juan with the constable, and going to his neighbor's
house read the warrant to him. Hubbs indignantly
replied that he was an American citizen, and did not
have to obey the order of the English officer. Thereupon
the constable left the house, vowing that he
would return with a force of men and compel the
farmer to obey him.</p>

<p>Mr. Hubbs was a shrewd man, and believed that
the constable would be as good as his word. As
soon as he had left Hubbs therefore sent a note to
Port Townsend, which was in Washington Territory,
asking the United States officers there to protect him
from arrest for killing his neighbor's pig. When he
received the note General William S. Harney, who
was in command, ordered Lieutenant-Colonel Casey
to take a company of soldiers and camp on San Juan
Island to protect Mr. Hubbs.</p>

<p>Now that thoughtless pig had actually lighted a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
fuse that threatened to lead to a very serious explosion.
As it happened San Juan lay near the middle
of the Strait of Juan de Fuca and commanded both
shores. The people at Victoria could see the American
soldiers setting out in their boats from Port
Townsend, and landing on the green island. So
long as it had been the home of a few farmers San
Juan had caused little concern, but now that troops
were camping upon it it presented quite a different
look. Victoria was all excitement. The governor,
Sir James Douglas, heard the news first, and then
Admiral Prevost, who was in command of some
English war-ships anchored in the little bay near the
city. The admiral was very angry and threatened
to blow the Yankees off the island. He gave orders
to move his fleet to one of the harbors of San Juan,
and his cannon were ready to fire shot over the
peaceful fields, where sheep and pigs had divided
possession. Sir James Douglas, the governor, however,
was a more peaceful man. He persuaded the
admiral not to be in a hurry, but suggested that it
would be wise to have a company of British regulars
camp somewhere on San Juan. This would serve as
a warning to the United States troops. Accordingly
Captain Delacombe was sent over, and pitched his
tents on the northern end of the island that belonged
to the Hudson's Bay Company.</p>

<p>As a result of the pig having trespassed in Mr.
Hubbs' vegetable patch, the flag of the United
States flew above the tents on the southern part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
San Juan, and the British flag over the tents on the
northern end. Mr. Hubbs was left in peace, and Mr.
Griffiths went on raising pigs; but the people in
Victoria shook their fists across the strait at the people
in Port Townsend, and in each of those cities
there was a great deal of talk about war. The talk
was mostly done by men who had nothing to do with
the army. The soldiers on the little island soon became
the best of friends, and spent their time in field
sports and giving dinner-parties to each other.</p>

<p>No part of the boundary line of the United States
has given more trouble than that in the northwest.
The Hudson's Bay Company had once claimed practically
all of what was known as Oregon Territory
for England, but after Marcus Whitman brought his
pioneers westward the Hudson's Bay Company
gradually withdrew, and left the southern part of that
land to the United States. For forty years the two
countries had disputed about the line of division, and
the political party that was led by Stephen A. Douglas
had taken as its watchword, "Fifty-four, forty,&mdash;or
fight!" which meant that unless the United States
should get all the land up to the southern line of
Alaska, they would go to war with England. Fortunately
President Polk was not so grasping, and
the boundary was finally settled in 1846 on latitude
forty-nine degrees. That was a clear enough boundary
for most of the northwest country, but when one
came close to the Pacific the coast grew ragged, and
was dotted with little islands. Vancouver was by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
the treaty to belong to England, and the agreement
said that the boundary at this corner should be "the
middle of the channel." Now it happened that San
Juan and its small neighbors lay midway between
the two shores, and the treaty failed to say which
channel was meant, the one on the American or the
one on the British side of San Juan.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact this question of the channel
was very important for the British. It would lead
them to the coast of Canada, or the United States to
Alaska. The one to the west, called the Canal de
Haro, was much straighter than the other, and deep
enough for the largest war-ships. Naturally the
United States wanted the boundary to run through
this channel, and the British equally naturally
wanted the boundary to run through the opposite
channel, called Rosario Strait, because midway between
lay the little island, which would make a
splendid fortress, and might prevent the passage of
ships in case of war between the two nations. So
long as the islands were simply pasture lands the
question of ownership was only a matter for debate,
but when the pig was killed, and the troops of both
countries camped on San Juan the question became
a much more vital one.</p>

<p>News of what had happened on San Juan was
sent to Washington and to London; and General
Winfield Scott hurried by way of Panama to Mr.
Hubbs' farm. He found that all the United States
troops on that part of the coast that could be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
spared had been crowded on to the southern part of
the island. This seemed unnecessary, and General
Scott agreed with Sir James Douglas that only one
company of United States and one of British soldiers
should stay in camp there. The little island thus
became the scene of what was known as "a joint
military occupation." In the meantime there were
many lengthy meetings at Washington and London,
and the two countries decided that they would leave
the difficult question of the boundary line to arbitration.
So the statesmen at Washington drew up
papers to prove that the right line lay in the middle
of the Canal de Haro, and statesmen at London
drew up other papers to show that the correct line
was through the middle of Rosario Strait, which
would give them San Juan and allow their ships to
sail in perfect safety between the islands and the
Vancouver shore. The statesmen and lawyers took
their time about this, while the soldiers amused themselves
fishing for cod and salmon, and the farmers
cared for their sheep and pigs as peacefully as in the
days before Hubbs had shot Griffiths' pig.</p>

<p>After some time the two nations decided to ask
the Emperor of Germany to decide the question of
the boundary line. The Emperor appointed three
learned men to determine the question for him.
They listened to the arguments of both sides, and
after much study made their report to the Emperor,
who gave his decision on October 23, 1872, and
handed a copy of it to Mr. Bancroft for the United<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
States, and to Lord Odo Russell for England. His
decision was that the claim of the United States was
correct, and that the middle of the Canal de Haro
should be the boundary of that northwestern corner.
This gave San Juan to the United States, much to
the disappointment of the people of Vancouver
Island, who knew that a fort on that little strip of
land could control all navigation through the Strait
of Juan de Fuca. One month after the decision was
given the British troops cut down their flagstaff on
the northern end and left San Juan.</p>

<p>San Juan lies opposite the city of Victoria, which
has grown to be one of the largest ports of British
Columbia. Instead of lessening in importance the
island has grown in value, because that part of the
country has filled up rapidly, and both sides of the
line are more and more prosperous. The question
of who should own San Juan would have been decided
some day, but it was that prowling pig that
brought matters to a head, and for a few weeks at
least threatened to draw two countries into war. On
such slight happenings (although in this case it was
a very serious matter for the pig) often hang the fates
of nations if we trace history back to the spark that
fired the fuse.</p>

<span class="larger">JOHN BROWN AT HARPER'S FERRY</span></h2>

<p>In the days when Kansas was the battle-ground
between those men who upheld negro slavery, and
those who attacked it, a man named John Brown
went from the east to that territory. Several of his
sons had already gone into Kansas, and had sent
him glowing accounts of it. Many New England
families were moving west by 1855, and building
homes for themselves on the splendid rolling prairies
across the Mississippi. John Brown, however, went
with another purpose. The years had built up in
him such a hatred for negro slavery that it filled his
whole thoughts. Kansas was the field where slave-owners
and abolitionists, or those who opposed
slavery, were to fight for the balance of power.
Therefore he went to Kansas and made his home in
the lowlands along the eastern border, near a region
that the Indians had named the Swamp of the Swan.</p>

<p>There were a great many men in Kansas at that
time who had no real convictions in regard to slavery,
and to whom the question was one of politics, and
not of religion, as it was to John Brown. Those were
days of warfare on the border, and men from the
south and the north were constantly clashing, fighting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
for the upper hand in the government, and taking
every possible advantage of each other. Five of
John Brown's sons had already settled in Kansas
when he came there with a sick son and a son-in-law.
Early in October, 1855, they reached the home of the
pioneers. They found the houses very primitive,
small log shanties, the walls plastered with mud.
The father joined his boys in getting in their hay,
and set traps in the woods to secure game for food.
But trouble was brewing in the town of Lawrence,
which was the leading city of Kansas. Word come
to the Swamp of the Swan that men who favored
slavery were marching on the town, intending to
drive out the free-state Northerners there. This was
a direct call to John Brown to take the field. His
family set to work preparing corn bread and meat,
blankets and cooking utensils, running bullets, and
loading guns. Then five of the men set out for
Lawrence, which was reached at the end of a twenty-four
hours' march.</p>

<p>The town of Lawrence, a collection of many
rude log houses, was filled with crowds of excited
men and women. John Brown, looking like a
patriarch with his long hair and beard, arrived at
sundown, accompanied by his stalwart sons armed
with guns and pistols. He was at once put in
charge of a company, and set to work fortifying
the town with earthworks, and preparing for a
battle. In a day or two, however, an agreement
was reached between the free-state and the slave-state<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
parties, and immediate danger of warfare disappeared.
Satisfied with this outcome, Brown and
his sons took to the road again, and marched back
to their home. There they stayed during the next
winter. In the cold of the long ice-bound months,
the passions of men lay dormant. But with the
coming of spring the old feud smouldered afresh.</p>

<p>Bands of armed men from the South arrived in
Kansas, and one from Georgia came to camp near
the Brown settlement on the Swamp of the Swan.
On a May morning John Brown and four of his
sons walked over to the new camp to learn the
Georgians' plans. He had some surveying instruments
with him, and the newcomers took him
for a government surveyor and therefore a slave
man, for almost every official that was sent into
Kansas held the Southern views. Pretending to be
a surveyor, the father directed his sons to busy
themselves in making a section line through the
camp. The men from Georgia looked on, talking
freely. Presently one of them said: "We've come
here to stay. We won't make no war on them
as minds their own business; but all the Abolitionists,
such as them Browns over there, we're
going to whip, drive out, or kill,&mdash;any way to
get shut of them!" The strangers went on to
name other settlers they meant to drive out, not
suspecting who their listeners were, and John Brown
wrote every word down in his surveyor's book.
A few days later the Georgians moved their camp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
nearer to the Brown settlement, and began to steal
horses and cattle belonging to the free-state men.
Brown took his list, and went to see the men whose
names were on it. They held a meeting, and
decided that it was time to teach the "border ruffians,"
as such men as the Georgians were called, a
lesson. News of the meeting spread rapidly, and
soon it was generally known that the free-state men
about Osawatomie, which was the name of the
town near which the Browns lived, were prepared to
take the war-path.</p>

<p>The old bitter feelings flamed up again in May of
1856. On the twenty-first of the month, a band of
slavery men swept down on the town of Lawrence,
and while the free-state citizens looked on, sacked
and burned the place. John Brown and his sons
hurried there, but when they reached Lawrence the
houses were in ashes. He denounced the free-state
men as cowards, for to his ardent nature it
seemed an outrage that men should let themselves
be treated so by ruffians. When a discreet citizen
said that they must act with caution John Brown
burst out at him: "Caution, caution, sir! I am
eternally tired of hearing that word caution&mdash;it is
nothing but the word for cowardice!" There was
nothing for him to do, however, and he was about to
turn toward home when a boy came dashing up.
He reported that the ruffians in the Swamp of
the Swan had warned all the women in the Brown
settlement that they must leave Kansas by Saturday<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
or Sunday, or they would be driven out. The
women had been frightened, and taking their children,
had fled in an ox-cart to the house of a
relative at a distance. The boy added that two
houses and a store near the settlement had been
burned.</p>

<p>Those were dark days on the border, days that
hardened men's natures. Such a man as John
Brown felt that it was his duty to stamp out the
pest of slavery at any cost. He turned to his
sons and to some German friends whose homes
had been burned. "I will attend to those fellows,"
said he. "Something must be done to show these
barbarians that we too have rights!" A neighbor
offered to carry the little band of men in his wagon.
They looked to their guns and cutlasses. Peace-loving
people in Lawrence grew uneasy. Judging
from Brown's expression, they feared that he was
going to sow further trouble.</p>

<p>Eight men drove back to the Browns' settlement,
and found that the messenger's story was correct.
They called a meeting of those who were to be
driven out of Kansas, according to the ruffians'
threats. At the meeting they decided to rid the
country of the outlaws, who had only come west to
plunder, and some of whom had been employed in
chasing runaway slaves who had escaped from
their masters. Their plans made, Brown's band
rode to a little saloon on the Pottawatomie Creek
where the raiders made their headquarters. Within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
an hour's walk were the men's cabins. Members
of Brown's band stopped at the door of each
cabin that night, and asked for the men they wanted.
If the inmates hesitated to open the door it was
broken open. Two of the men on their list could
not be found, but five were led out into the woods
and killed. It was a horrible deed, barbarous even
in those days of bloodshed. But Brown's men felt
that they were forced to do it.</p>

<p>John Brown thought that this one desperate act
might set Kansas free; but it only marked the
beginning of a long and bloody drama. As soon
as the facts were known he and his sons became
outlaws with prices on their heads. Even his neighbors
at Osawatomie were horrified at his act. Two
of his sons who had not been with him were arrested,
and the little settlement became a center
of suspicion. The father withdrew to the woods,
and there about thirty-five men gathered about
him. They lived the life of outlaws, and neither
slave-state nor free-state officers dared to try to
capture them. By chance a reporter of the New
York <i class="publication">Tribune</i> came on their camp. He wrote:
"I shall not soon forget the scene that here opened
to my view. Near the edge of the creek a dozen
horses were tied, all ready saddled for a ride for
life, or a hunt after Southern invaders. A dozen
rifles and sabres were stacked against the trees.
In an open space, amid the shady and lofty woods,
there was a great blazing fire with a pot on it;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
a woman, bareheaded, with an honest sunburnt face,
was picking blackberries from the bushes; three
or four armed men were lying on red and blue
blankets on the grass; and two fine-looking youths
were standing, leaning on their arms, on guard
near by.... Old Brown himself stood near
the fire, with his shirt sleeves rolled up, and a large
piece of pork in his hand. He was cooking a pig.
He was poorly clad, and his toes protruded from his
boots. The old man received me with great cordiality,
and the little band gathered about me."</p>

<p>This band, living in forest and swamp, was always
ready to strike a blow for the free-state cause. The
slavery men were getting the upper hand, and
Northern families who had settled in Kansas began
to look to John Brown for protection. The "border
ruffians" grew worse and worse, attacking small defenseless
settlements, burning homes and carrying
off cattle. Sometimes it was only the fear of retaliation
from Brown's company that kept the raiders
from still greater crimes. Occasionally they met;
once they fought a battle at Black Jack, and twenty-four
of the enemy finally surrendered to nine of
Brown's men. One of the leader's sons was badly
wounded, and the father had to nurse him in the
woods.</p>

<p>Affairs grew worse during the summer. The
vilest scum of the slave states poured into Kansas,
and the scenes on the border grew more and more
disgraceful. There were pitched battles, and at last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
the governor of the territory, thoroughly scared, surrendered
his power into the hands of the slave-holders,
and fled for his life. The slave-state men
thought that the time had come to strike a blow that
should settle the question in Kansas permanently.
They prepared to gather an army in Missouri, intending
to cross into Kansas, and so terrify settlers
from the North that they would make no further resistance.
Conditions looked desperate to John
Brown, and he left the territory for a short time to
see what he could do to get help for his cause.</p>

<p>A large band of emigrants from the North were on
the march toward Kansas, and Brown rode to meet
them. The emigrants had heard of him, and welcomed
him to their midst. He encouraged them
and urged them to fight for freedom, and went on
his way hoping to rouse more free-state men to enter
Kansas.</p>

<p>The East was now thoroughly awake to the lawless
situation on the border, and a new governor,
Geary by name, was sent out from Washington.
Meetings were held in the large cities, and money,
arms, and men began to pour into Kansas. Several
hundred men from Missouri attacked Osawatomie,
which was defended by Abolitionists, and a battle
followed. John Brown was there, and when his
party won the day he gained the nickname of
"Osawatomie Brown," by which he was generally
called thereafter.</p>

<p>Fired by this success, the leaders of the free-state<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
army planned to capture Lawrence. The new governor
feared that such an act would mean the beginning
of a general civil war, and did his best to prevent
it. He succeeded in this. The free-state men
were divided into two parties, those whose aim was
to have Kansas admitted to the Union as a free state,
and those who, like John Brown, were bent on abolishing
slavery throughout the United States. Governor
Geary assured the former men that Kansas
would be free soil, and he tried to induce Brown to
leave that part of the country for a time in the interest
of peace. Brown was willing to do as Governor
Geary wished, thinking that Kansas was safe for the
present. He wanted to turn his attention to other
parts of the country, where he thought he was more
needed. In September, 1856, he started east with
his sons. He was now a well-known figure, hated
by all slave-owners, a hero to Abolitionists, and distrusted
by that large number of men whose object
was to secure peace at any cost.</p>

<p>There were many people in the North at that time
who were helping runaway slaves to escape from
their masters, and in certain parts of the country
there were stations of what was called the "Underground
Railroad." Negroes fleeing from the
tyranny of Southern owners were helped along from
one station to another, until they were finally safe
across the Canadian border. The law of the country
said that negro slaves were like any other form of
property, and that it was the duty of citizens to return<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
runaways to their masters. There were also
scattered through the border states a number of men
whose business it was to catch fugitive slaves and
take them back south. These men were usually of
a brutal type, and the poor refugee who fell into
their clutches was made to suffer for his attempt at
escape. Story after story of the sufferings of slaves
came to John Brown's ears, and he felt that it was
his duty to throw himself into the work of the Underground
Railroad, and help as many slaves as
possible to cross into Canada.</p>

<p>This work was not enough for him, however; he
wanted to strike some blow at the slave-owners
themselves. The Alleghany Mountain range was
one of the main roads for fugitives, for there men
could hide in the thick forests of the mountainside,
and could make some show of defense when the
slave-catchers and bloodhounds came in pursuit.
John Brown knew this country well. He traveled
through the North, talking with other men who felt
as he did, and trying to work out a plan which
should force the country to decide this question of
negro slavery. At last he decided to make a raid
into Southern territory, and free slaves for himself.</p>

<p>In the heart of the Alleghanies, and almost midway
between Maine and Florida, is a great natural
gateway in the mountains. Here the Potomac and
the Shenandoah Rivers meet, and seem to force their
way through the natural barrier. This pass is
Harper's Ferry, and in 1859 it was the seat of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
United States arsenal. To the south was a country
filled with slaves, who looked to Harper's Ferry as
the highroad to freedom. Not far from the arsenal
rose the Blue Ridge Mountains, the heights of which
commanded the pass. It was John Brown's plan to
lead men from the Maryland side of the Potomac
River to attack the arsenal, and when it was captured
to carry arms and ammunition across the Shenandoah
to Loudoun Heights in the Blue Ridge, and
hide there. From here his band could make raids
to the south, freeing slaves, and shielding them
from their masters, while using the mountains for a
shelter.</p>

<p>There were many other men in the United States
bent on destroying slavery, but few so impulsive as
John Brown. His plan was rash in the extreme, and
even its success would have profited only a few slaves.
But Brown was a born crusader. The men who followed
him were all impulsive, and many of them
were already trained in the rude ways of frontier life.
They knew what he had done in Kansas, and were
ready to fight on his side anywhere else. They had
a real reverence for John Brown. The tall man with
the long, almost white hair, keen eyes, and flowing
beard was no ordinary leader. He had the power
to convince men that his cause was just, and to hold
them in his service afterward.</p>

<p>In June, 1859, John Brown, with two of his sons,
and two friends, started south. He rented a farm
about five miles from Harper's Ferry, in a quiet, out-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>of-the-way
place. There were several cabins in the
neighborhood, and as his followers gradually joined
him, they occupied these shelters. A daughter kept
house for him during the summer. The men farmed
in the daytime, and planned their conspiracy at night.
The leader did everything he could to win the friendship
of his neighbors. He had some knowledge of
medicine, and attended all who were sick. Frequently
he preached in the little Dunker chapel
near by. He was always ready to share his food or
give the shelter of his roof to any travelers. Slowly
he collected guns and ammunition, and late in
September sent his daughter north, and arranged to
make his attack. At first some of the other men
objected to his plans. One or two did not approve
of his seizing the government arsenal, and thought
they should simply make a raid into Virginia as the
slave-state men had formerly carried war into
Kansas. Their leader, however, was determined,
and nothing could turn him. Already he feared lest
some suspicion of his purpose might have spread,
and was eager to make his start. He set Sunday
night, October 16th, as the time for the raid.
That morning he called his men together and read
to them from the Bible. In the afternoon he gave
them final instructions, and added: "And now,
gentlemen, let me impress this one thing upon your
minds. You all know how dear life is to you, and
how dear life is to your friends. And in remembering
that, consider that the lives of others are as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
dear to them as yours are to you. Do not, therefore,
take the life of any one, if you can possibly
avoid it; but if it is necessary to take life in order to
save your own, then make sure work of it."</p>

<p>At eight o'clock that night the old farm was alive
with action. John Brown called: "Men, get on
your arms; we will proceed to the Ferry." His
horse and wagon were driven up before the door,
and some pikes, a sledge-hammer, and a crowbar
were put in it. John Brown pulled on his old
Kansas cap, and cried: "Come, boys!" and they
went into the lane that wound down the hill to the
highroad.</p>

<p>Each of the band had been told exactly what he
was to do. Two of the men were to cut the
telegraph lines, and two others were to detain the
sentinels at the bridge. Men were detailed to hold
each of the bridges over the two rivers, and others
to occupy the engine house in the arsenal yard.</p>

<p>The night was cold and dark. John Brown drove
his one-horse farm-wagon, and the men straggled
behind him. They had to cover five miles through
woods and over hills before they came down to the
narrow road between the cliffs and the Cincinnati
and Ohio canal. Telegraph wires were cut, the
watchman on the bridge was arrested, and the band
found their way open into Harper's Ferry.</p>

<p>Their object was to seize the arms in the arsenal
and rifle factory. They marched to the armory
gate, where they found a watchman. "Open the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
gate," one of Brown's men ordered. The watchman
said that he could not, and another of the band
declared that there was no time for talk, but that he
would get a crowbar and hammer from the wagon.
He twisted the crowbar in the chain that held the gate,
and broke it open; then leaving the watchman in the
care of two men, the rest made a dash for the
arsenal.</p>

<p>A great deal happened in a short time. Guards
were overpowered, the bridge secured, and the river
forded close to the rifle-works. Not a gun had to
be fired, and both soldiers and civilians did as they
were bid by the armed men. Others of the raiders
hurried out into the country, and meeting some
colored men, told them their plans, and the latter at
once agreed to join them. Each of the negroes
was sent at once to stir up the slaves in the neighborhood,
and bring them to Harper's Ferry. The
raiders then came to the house of Colonel Lewis
Washington. They knocked on the door, and were
admitted. Colonel Washington asked what they
wanted. The leader answered, "You are our
prisoner, and must come to the Ferry with us."
The Virginian replied, "You can have my slaves, if
you will let me remain." He was told, however,
that he must go back with them; and so he did, together
with a large four-horse wagon and some arms,
guns, swords, and cartridges.</p>

<p>Others of the band had brought in more Virginia
prisoners. An east-bound train on the Baltimore and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
Ohio Railroad that reached Harper's Ferry about
one o'clock in the morning was detained, and the
passengers were kept there until sunrise. John
Brown was in command at the arsenal, and the rest
of his band were acting at different points. By
morning the people of the village were all alarmed.
They did not know what the raiders meant to do,
but many of them fled to the mountains, spreading
the news as they went.</p>

<p>In spite of some little confusion among his followers,
practically all of John Brown's plans had been
successful up to this point. He had captured the
armory, and armed about fifty slaves. His next object
was to get the store of guns and ammunition
that he had left at his farm. Here came the first
hitch in his plans. He ordered two of his men,
Cook and Tidd, to take some of the freed slaves in
Colonel Washington's wagon, and drive to the house
of a man named Terrence Burns, and take him, his
brother and their slaves prisoners. Cook was to
stay at Burns's house while Tidd and the negroes
were to go to John Brown's farm, load the guns in
the wagon, and bring them back to a schoolhouse
near the Ferry, stopping on the way for Cook and
his prisoners. This the two men did; but they were
so slow in getting the arms from the farm to the
schoolhouse, a distance of not over three miles, that
much valuable time was lost. Cook halted to make
a speech on human equality at one of the houses
they passed, and Tidd stopped his wagon frequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
and talked with passers-by on the road. They had
the first load of arms at the schoolhouse by ten
o'clock in the morning, but it was four o'clock in the
afternoon before the second load arrived. All the
guns and arms should have been at the schoolhouse
by ten o'clock, if the men had followed John Brown's
orders strictly.</p>

<p>John Brown probably still intended to carry his
arms, together with the prisoners and their slaves,
up to Loudoun Heights, where he would be safe for
some time, but his men were so slow in obeying his
orders that the enemy was given time to collect.
The train that had left Harper's Ferry that morning
carried word of the raid throughout the countryside,
and men gathered in the neighboring villages ready
to march on Harper's Ferry and put an end to the
disturbance. John Brown held thousands of muskets
and rifles in the arsenal, while the men who were
marching to attack him were for the most part armed
with squirrel guns and old-fashioned fowling-pieces.
The militia collected rapidly, and marched toward
the Ferry from all directions. By noon the Jefferson
Guards had seized the bridge that crossed the Potomac.
Meantime John Brown had girded to his side
a sword that had belonged to Lafayette, that had
been taken from Colonel Lewis Washington's house
the night before, called his men from the arsenal into
the street, and said, "The troops are on the bridge,
coming into town; we will give them a warm reception."
He walked back and forth before the small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
band, encouraging them. "Men, be cool!" he
urged. "Don't waste your powder and shot! Take
aim, and make every shot count! The troops will
look for us to retreat on their first appearance; be
careful to shoot first."</p>

<p>The militia soon advanced across the bridge and
up the main street. When they were some sixty or
seventy yards away from the raiders John Brown
gave the order to fire. Some of the militia fell.
Other volleys followed; and the attacking party was
thrown into disorder. Finally they were driven back
to the bridge, and took up a position there until reinforcements
arrived. As they retreated John Brown
ordered his men back to the arsenal. In the lull of
the firing nearly all the unarmed people who were
still in the town fled to the hills.</p>

<p>It was now one o'clock in the afternoon, and the
band of raiders could have escaped to Loudoun
Heights. But their leader wanted to carry the guns
and ammunition away with him, and to do this he
needed the aid of the rest of his men. He sent a
messenger to one of his followers named Kagi, who
was stationed with several others on the bank of the
Shenandoah, with orders for him to hold the place a
short time longer. The messenger, however, was
fired on and wounded before he could reach Kagi,
and the latter's party was soon attacked by a force
of militia, and driven into the river. A large flat
rock stood up in the river, and four of the five raiders
reached this. There three of them fell before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
fire of bullets, and the fourth was taken a prisoner.
In similar ways the number of John Brown's men
was much reduced.</p>

<p>The leader realized the danger of the situation,
and decided that his best chance of escape lay in
using the prisoners he had captured as hostages for
his band's safe retreat. He moved his men, and the
more important of the prisoners, to a small brick
building called the engine-house. There he said to
his captives, "Gentlemen, perhaps you wonder why
I have selected you from the others. It is because I
believe you to be the most influential; and I have
only to say now that you will have to share precisely
the same fate that your friends extend to my men."
He ordered the doors and windows barricaded, and
port-holes cut in the walls.</p>

<p>The engine-house now became the raiders' citadel,
and the militia and bands of farmers who were arriving
at Harper's Ferry released the prisoners who
were still in the arsenal, and concentrated all their
fire on the band in the small brick house.</p>

<p>As the sun set the town filled with troops, and it
was evident that the men in the fort would have to
surrender. They kept up their firing, however, from
the port-holes, and were answered with a rain of
bullets aimed at the doors and windows. Both sides
lost a number of men. Two of John Brown's sons
had been shot during the day. Finally the leader
asked if one of his prisoners would volunteer to go
out among the citizens and induce them to cease firing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
on the fort, as they were endangering the lives
of their friends, the other captives. He promised
that if they would stop firing his men would do the
same. One of the prisoners agreed to try this, and
the firing ceased for a time.</p>

<p>More troops poured into Harper's Ferry, and presently
Colonel Robert E. Lee arrived with a force of
United States marines. Guards were set about the
engine-house to see that John Brown and his men
did not escape. Then Colonel Lee sent a flag of
truce to the engine-house, and in the name of the
United States demanded that Brown surrender, advising
him to throw himself on the clemency of the
government. John Brown answered that he knew
what that meant, and added, "I prefer to die just
here." Again in the morning Lee sent his aide to
the fort. The officer asked, "Are you ready to surrender,
and trust to the mercy of the government?"
Brown answered, "No, I prefer to die here." Then
the soldiers attacked, not with guns this time, but
with sledge-hammers, intending to break down the
doors. This did not succeed, and seizing a long
ladder they used it as a battering-ram, and finally
broke the fastenings of the main door. Lieutenant
Green pushed his way in, and, jumping on top of
the engine, looked about for John Brown. Amid a
storm of bullets, he saw the white-haired leader, and
sprang at him, at the same time striking at him with
his sword. John Brown fell forward, with his head
between his knees. In a few minutes all of the raiders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
who were left in the engine-house had surrendered
to the government troops.</p>

<p>Of the band that had left the farm on Sunday
night seven were taken prisoners, ten had been killed
in the fighting, and six others had managed to make
their escape. By noon of Tuesday, October 18th,
the raid was over. John Brown, wounded in half a
dozen places, lay on the floor of the engine-house;
and the governor of Virginia bent over him. "Who
are you?" asked the governor. The old man answered,
"My name is John Brown; I have been well
known as old John Brown of Kansas. Two of my
sons were killed here to-day, and I'm dying too. I
came here to liberate slaves, and was to receive no
reward. I have acted from a sense of duty, and am
content to await my fate; but I think the crowd have
treated me badly. I am an old man. Yesterday I
could have killed whom I chose; but I had no desire
to kill any person, and would not have killed a man
had they not tried to kill me and my men. I could
have sacked and burned the town, but did not; I
have treated the persons whom I took as hostages
kindly, and I appeal to them for the truth of what I
say. If I had succeeded in running off slaves this
time, I could have raised twenty times as many men
as I have now for a similar expedition. But I have
failed."</p>

<p>The news of John Brown's raid spread through the
country, and the people North and South were
amazed and bewildered. They had grown used to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
hearing of warfare in the distant borderland of
Kansas, but this was a battle that had taken place in
the very heart of the Union. Men did not know
what to think of it. John Brown appeared to many
of them as a monstrous figure, a firebrand who
would touch his torch to the tinder of slavery, and
set the whole nation in a blaze. Newspapers and
public speakers denounced him. They said he was
attacking the foundations of the country when he
seized the arsenal and freed slaves from their lawful
owners. Only a handful of men had any good to
say for him, and that handful were looked upon as
madmen by their neighbors. Only a few could read
the handwriting on the wall, and realize that John
Brown was merely a year or two in advance of the
times.</p>

<p>We who know the story of the Civil War and the
abolition of slavery think of John Brown as a hero.
We forget the outlaw and remember the martyr. If
he was setting the laws of men at defiance he was
also following the law that he felt was given him by
God. His faith and his simplicity have made him a
great figure in history. A man who met him riding
across the plains of Kansas in the days of the border
warfare drew a vivid picture of him. He said that
a tall man on horseback stopped and asked him a
question. "It was on a late July day, and in its
hottest hours. I had been idly watching a wagon
and one horse toiling slowly northward across the
prairie, along the emigrant trail that had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
marked out by free-state men.... John Brown,
whose name the young and ardent had begun to
conjure with and swear by, had been described to
me. So, as I heard the question, I looked up and
met the full, strong gaze of a pair of luminous, questioning
eyes. Somehow I instinctively knew this was
John Brown, and with that name I replied....
It was a long, rugged-featured face I saw. A tall,
sinewy figure, too (he had dismounted), five feet
eleven, I estimated, with square shoulders, narrow
flank, sinewy and deep-chested. A frame full of
nervous power, but not impressing one especially
with muscular vigor. The impression left by the
pose and the figure was that of reserve, endurance,
and quiet strength. The questioning voice-tones
were mellow, magnetic, and grave. On the weatherworn
face was a stubby, short, gray beard....
This figure,&mdash;unarmed, poorly clad, with coarse
linen trousers tucked into high, heavy cowhide
boots, with heavy spurs on their heels, a cotton
shirt opened at the throat, a long torn linen duster,
and a bewrayed chip straw hat ... made up the
outward garb and appearance of John Brown when I
first met him. In ten minutes his mounted figure
disappeared over the north horizon."</p>

<p>But John Brown had seized the government's
arsenal, and put arms in the hands of negro slaves,
and therefore the law must take its course with him.
Its officers came to him where he lay on the floor of
his fort, a badly-wounded man, who had fought for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
fifty-five long hours, who had seen two sons and eight
of his comrades shot in the battle, and who felt that
his cause was lost.</p>

<p>When men who owned slaves asked the reason for
his raid, he answered, "You are guilty of a great
wrong against God and humanity and it would be perfectly
right for any one to interfere with you so far
as to free those you wilfully and wickedly hold in
bondage.... I pity the poor in bondage that
have none to help them. That is why I am here;
not to gratify any personal animosity, revenge, or
vindictive spirit."</p>

<p>A number of Virginians had been killed in the
fight, and it was difficult to secure a fair trial for the
raiders. The state did its best to hold the scales of
justice even. The formal trial began on October 27,
1859. Friends from the North came to his aid, and
a Massachusetts lawyer acted as his counsel. John
Brown heard the charges against him lying on a
straw pallet, and four days later he heard the jury
declare him guilty of treason. December 2, 1859,
the sentence of the court was carried out, and John
Brown was hanged as a traitor. His last written
words were, "I, John Brown, am quite certain that
the crimes of this guilty land will never be purged
away but with blood. I had, as I now think vainly,
flattered myself that without very much bloodshed it
might be done."</p>

<p>Every great cause in history has its martyrs, and
John Brown was one of those who were sacrificed in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
battle for human freedom. Statesmen had tried for
years to argue away the wrongs that began when the
first African bondsmen were brought to the American
colonies. Statesmen, however, cannot change the
views of men and women as to what is right and
wrong, and all the arguments in the world could not
convince such men as John Brown and his friends
that one man had a right to the possession of a fellow-creature.
He struck his blow wildly, but its echo
rang in the ears of the North, and never ceased until
the Civil War was ended, and slavery wiped off the
continent. The great negro orator, Frederick
Douglass, said twenty-two years later at Harper's
Ferry, "If John Brown did not end the war that
ended slavery, he did, at least, begin the war that
ended slavery. If we look over the dates, places,
and men for which this honor is claimed, we shall
find that not Carolina, but Virginia, not Fort Sumter,
but Harper's Ferry and the arsenal, not Major
Anderson, but John Brown began the war that
ended American slavery, and made this a free
republic.... When John Brown stretched forth
his arm the sky was cleared,&mdash;the armed hosts of
freedom stood face to face over the chasm of a
broken Union, and the clash of arms was at hand."</p>

<p>In the spring of 1861 the Boston Light Infantry
went to Fort Warren in Boston Harbor to drill.
They formed a quartette to sing patriotic songs,
and some one wrote the verses that are known as
"John Brown's Body," and set them to the music of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
an old camp-meeting tune. Regiment after regiment
heard the song and carried it with them into
camp and battle. So the spirit of the simple crusader
went marching on through the war, and his
name was linked forever with the cause of freedom.</p>

<span class="larger">AN ARCTIC EXPLORER</span></h2>

<p>When Columbus sailed from Palos in 1492 he
hoped to find a shorter route to Cathay or China
than any that was then known, and the great
explorers who followed after him had the same hope
of such a discovery in their minds. When men
learned that instead of finding a short route to
China they had come upon two great continents
that shared the Western Ocean, they turned their
thoughts to discovering what was known as the
Northwest Passage. They hoped to find a way by
which ships might sail from the Atlantic to the
Pacific Ocean north of America. The great English
explorers in particular were eager to find such an
ocean route, and this search was the real beginning
of the fur-trading around Hudson's Bay, the cod-fishing
of Newfoundland, and the whale-fishing of
Baffin Bay.</p>

<p>One sea-captain after another sailed across the
Atlantic, and strove to find the passage through the
Arctic regions; but the world of snow and ice
defeated each of them. Some went back to report
that there was no Northwest Passage, and others<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
were lost among the ice-floes and never returned.
Then in 1845 England decided to send a great
expedition to make another attempt, and put at the
head of it Sir John Franklin, a brave captain who
had fought with Nelson and knew the sea in all
its variety. He sailed from England May 26, 1845,
taking one hundred and twenty-nine men in the two
ships <i class="ship">Erebus</i> and <i class="ship">Terror</i>. He carried enough provisions
to last him for three years. On July 26,
1845, Franklin's two vessels were seen by the captain
of a whaler, moored to an iceberg in Baffin
Bay. They were waiting for an opening in the
middle of an ice-pack, through which they might
sail across the bay and enter Lancaster Sound.
They were never seen again, and the question of
what had happened to Sir John Franklin's party
became one of the mysteries of the age.</p>

<p>More than twenty ships, with crews of nearly
two thousand officers and men, at a cost of many
millions of dollars, sought for Sir John Franklin in the
years between 1847 and 1853. One heroic explorer
after another sailed into the Arctic, crossed the ice-floes,
and searched for some trace of the missing
men. But none could be found, and one after
another the explorers came back, their only report
being that the ice had swallowed all traces of the
English captain and his vessels. At length the last
of the expeditions sent out by the English Government
returned, and the world decided that the
mystery would never be solved. But brave Lady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
Franklin, the wife of Sir John, urged still other men
to seek for news, and at last explorers found that all
of Franklin's expedition had perished in their search
for the Northwest Passage.</p>

<p>Arctic explorers usually leave records telling the
story of their discoveries at different points along
the road they follow. For a long time after the
fate of Franklin's party was known, men tried
to find records he might have left in cairns, or
piles of stones through the Arctic regions. Whale
vessels sometimes brought news of such records,
but most of them proved to be idle yarns told by
the whalers to surprise their friends at home. One
of these stories was that all the missing records of
Sir John Franklin were to be found in a cairn which
was built near Repulse Bay. This story was told so
often that people came to believe it was true,
and some young Americans set out to make a
search of King William Land and try to find the
cairn. The party sailed on the whaler <i class="ship">Eothen</i>, and
five men landed at Repulse Bay. The leader was
Lieutenant Frederick Schwatka, of the United
States Army. He had three friends with him named
Gilder, Klutschak, and Melms, and with them was
an Eskimo, who was known as Joe.</p>

<p>The young Americans set up a winter camp
on Chesterfield Inlet, and tried to live as much like
the native Eskimos as possible. During the winter
they met many natives on their hunting-trips, and
the latter soon convinced them that they were on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
wild-goose chase, and that the story of the cairn
was probably only a sailor's yarn. Lieutenant
Schwatka, however, was not the sort of man to
return home without some results from his trip, and
so he made up his mind to go into the country
where Franklin's party had perished, hoping that he
might find some record which would throw light
on the earlier explorer's travels.</p>

<p>The Eskimos were a race largely unknown to
civilized men. White men had seen much more
of the native American Indians who lived in more
temperate climates. These young Americans found
a great deal to interest them during the winter
among these strange people of the far North.
Hunting was their chief pursuit, and the Americans
found that they spent much of their time indoors
playing a game called <i xml:lang="iu" lang="iu">Nu-glew-tar</i>, which sharpened
their quickness of eye and sureness of aim.
It was a simple sport; a small piece of bone, pierced
with a row of small holes, was hung from the roof of
the hut by a rope of walrus hide, and a heavy
weight was fastened to the end of the bone to keep
it from swinging. The Eskimo players were each
armed with a small sharp-pointed stick, and each in
turn would thrust his stick at the bone, trying to
pierce one of the holes. The prize was won by
the player who pierced the bone and held it fast
with his stick.</p>

<p>As soon as spring opened Lieutenant Schwatka
started out, leaving his winter camp in April, 1879,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
and crossing in as straight a line as possible to
Montreal Island, near the mouth of the Black
River. He took with him twelve Eskimos, men,
women, and children, and dogs to pull the sledges.
They carried food for one month only, intending to
hunt during the summer. Every night the Eskimos
built snow huts, or igloos, in which the party camped.
As they went on they met men of another Arctic
tribe, the Ook-joo-liks, who wore shoes and gloves
made of musk-ox skin, which was covered with
hair several inches long, and made the wearers look
more like bears than like men. One of these natives
said that he had seen a ship that had sunk off
Adelaide Peninsula, and that he and his friends
had obtained such articles as spoons, knives, and
plates from the ship. Lieutenant Schwatka thought
the ship was probably either the <i class="ship">Erebus</i> or the <i class="ship">Terror</i>.
Later his party found an old woman who said that
when she had been on the southeast coast of King
William Land not many years before she had seen
ten white men dragging a sledge with a boat on it.
Five of the white men put up a tent on the shore
and five stayed with the boat. Some men of the
woman's tribe had killed seals and given them to
the white men; then the white men had left, and
neither she nor any of her tribe had seen them
again. Asking questions of the Eskimos he met,
Lieutenant Schwatka and his comrades gradually
pieced together the story of what had happened
to Franklin and his men. But the American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
was not content with what he had learned in
this way, and he determined to cross Simpson
Strait to King William Land, and search for
records there during the summer. This meant
that he would have to spend the summer on this
bare and desolate island, as there would be no
chance to cross the strait until the cold weather of
autumn should form new ice for a bridge.</p>

<p>The Eskimos did everything they could to persuade
him not to cross to the island. They told him
that in 1848 more than one hundred men had
perished of starvation there, and added that no one
could find sufficient food to keep them through the
summer. Yet the fearless soldier and his friends insisted
on making the attempt, and some of the
Eskimos were daring enough to go with them.</p>

<p>It seemed doubtful whether they could even get
across the strait. Every few steps some man would
sink into the ice-pack up to his waist and his legs
would dangle in slush without finding bottom. The
sledges would sink so that the dogs, floundering
and scrambling, could not pull them. The men
had to push the dog-teams along, and after the first
day's travel they were all so exhausted that they had
to rest the whole of the next day before they could
start on again. Finally they reached the opposite
shore of the strait, and, while the natives built igloos
and hunted, the Americans searched for records of
Franklin's party. They found enough traces to
prove that the men who had sought the Northwest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
Passage had spent some time on this desolate strip
of land.</p>

<p>More than once they were in danger of starvation.
In the spring the Eskimos hunted wild ducks, which
they found in remote stretches of water. Their way
of hunting was to steal up on a flock of the birds,
and, as soon as the ducks took alarm, to rush toward
the largest bunch of them. The hunter then threw
his spear, made with three barbs of different lengths,
and caught the duck on the sharp central prong.
The long wooden shaft of the spear would keep the
duck floating on the water until the hunter could
seize it. But as summer drew on, and the ducks
migrated, food grew very scarce. Once or twice
they discovered bears, which they shot, and when
there was nothing else to eat they lived on a small
black berry that the Eskimos called <i xml:lang="iu" lang="iu">parawong</i>, which
proved very sustaining.</p>

<p>As the white men tramped day after day over the
icy hillocks their footwear wore out, and often walking
became a torment. In telling of their march
Gilder said, "We were either wading through the
hillside torrents or lakes, which, frozen on the bottom,
made the footing exceedingly treacherous, or
else with sealskin boots, soft by constant wetting,
painfully plodding over sharp stones set firmly in the
ground with the edges pointed up. Sometimes as a
new method of injury, stepping and slipping on flat
stones, the unwary foot slid into a crevice that seemingly
wrenched it from the body."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
When they had nothing else to eat the white men
lived on the same food as the native hunters. This
was generally a tallow made from the reindeer, and
eaten with strips of reindeer meat. A dish of this,
mixed with seal-oil, was said to look like ice-cream
and took the place of that dessert with the Eskimos.
Lieutenant Schwatka said, however, that instead of
tasting like ice-cream it reminded him more of
locust, sawdust and wild-honey.</p>

<p>As autumn drew on they made ready to cross back
to the mainland; but it took some time for the ice to
form on the strait. Gilder said of their camp life:
"We eat quantities of reindeer tallow with our meat,
probably about half of our daily food. Breakfast is
eaten raw and frozen, but we generally have a warm
meal in the evening. Fuel is hard to obtain and
now consists of a vine-like moss called <i xml:lang="iu" lang="iu">ik-shoot-ik</i>.
Reindeer tallow is used for a light. A small, flat
stone serves for a candlestick, on which a lump of
tallow is placed close to a piece of fibrous moss
called <i xml:lang="iu" lang="iu">mun-ne</i>, which is used for a wick. The melting
tallow runs down upon the stone and is immediately
absorbed by the moss. This makes a cheerful
and pleasant light, but is most exasperating to a
hungry man as it smells exactly like frying meat.
Eating such quantities of tallow is a great benefit in
this climate, and we can easily see the effects of it in
the comfort with which we meet the cold."</p>

<p>As soon as the ice on the strait was frozen hard
enough the reindeer crossed it, and by the middle of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
October King William Land was practically deserted.
Then the Americans and Eskimos started back to
the mainland. Winter had now come, and the
weather was intensely cold, often ninety degrees below
freezing. In December the traveling grew
worse, and food became so scarce that they had to
stop day after day for hunting. In January a blizzard
struck their camp and lasted thirteen days;
then wolves prowled about them at night, and once
actually killed four of their dogs. "A sealskin full
of blubber," said Gilder, "would have saved many
of our dogs; but we had none to spare for them, as
we were reduced to the point when we had to save
it exclusively for lighting the igloos at night. We
could not use it to warm our igloos or to cook with.
Our meat had to be eaten cold&mdash;that is, frozen so
solid that it had to be sawed and then broken into
convenient-sized lumps, which when first put into
the mouth were like stones. Sometimes, however,
the snow was beaten off the moss on the hillsides and
enough was gathered to cook a meal."</p>

<p>When they were almost on the point of starvation
a walrus was killed, and supplied them with food to
last until they got back to the nearest Eskimo village.
From the coast they took ship to the United
States. The records they brought with them practically
completed the account of what had happened
to Sir John Franklin's ill-fated expedition. And almost
equally important were the new details they
brought in regard to Eskimo life, and the proof they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
gave that men of the temperate zone could pass a
year in the frozen land of the far north if they would
live as the natives did, and adapt themselves to the
rigors of that climate.</p>

<span class="larger">THE STORY OF ALASKA</span></h2>

<p>In the far northwestern corner of North America is a
land that has had few stirring scenes in its history.
It is an enormous tract, close to the Arctic Sea, and
far from the busy cities of the United States. Not
until long after the English, French, and Spanish discoverers
had explored the country in the Temperate
Zone did any European find Alaska. Even when it
was found it seemed to offer little but ice-fields and
desolate prairies, leading to wild mountain ranges
that did not tempt men to settle. Seal hunters came
and went, but generally left the native Indians in
peace. Most of these hunters came from Siberia, for
the Russians were the first owners of this land.</p>

<p>An officer in the Russian Navy named Vitus Bering
found the strait that is called by his name in
1728. Some years later he was sent into the Arctic
Sea again by the Empress Anne of Russia to try to
find the wonderful country that Vasco de Gama had
sought. He sailed in summer, and after weathering
heavy storms finally reached Kayak Island on St.
Elias Day, July 17, 1741, and named the great mountain
peak in honor of that saint. More storms followed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
and soon afterward the brave sailor was shipwrecked
and drowned off the Comandorski Islands.
His crew managed to get back to Siberia, having
lived on the meat of the seals they were able to shoot.
Russian traders saw the sealskins they brought home,
and sent out expeditions to obtain more furs. Some
returned richly laden, but others were lost in storms
and never heard from. There was so much danger
in the hunting that it was not until 1783 that Russian
merchants actually established trading-posts in
Alaska. Then a rich merchant of Siberia named
Gregory Shelikoff built a post on Kadiak Island, and
took into partnership with him a Russian named
Alexander Baranof. Baranof built a fort on an island
named for him, some three miles north of the present
city of Sitka. The two men formed the Russian
American Fur Company, and Baranof became its
manager in America.</p>

<p>One day a seal hunter came to Baranof at his
fortress, and took from his pocket a handful of nuggets
and scales of gold. He held them out to the
Russian, and said that he knew where many more
like them were to be found. "Ivan," said Baranof,
"I forbid you to seek for any more. You must not
say a word about this, or there will be trouble. If
the Americans or the English know that there is gold
in these mountains we will be ruined. They will
rush in here by the thousands, and crowd us to the
wall." Baranof was a fur merchant, and did not
want to see miners flocking to his land, as his company<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
was growing rich from the seals and fur-trading
with the natives.</p>

<p>Little by little, however, the news leaked out that
the northwestern country had rich minerals, and soon
the King of Spain began to covet some of that
wealth for himself. The Spaniards claimed that they
owned all of the country that had not yet been
mapped out, and they sent an exploring party, under
Perez, to make charts of the northwest. Perez sailed
along the coast, and finding two capes, named them
Santa Margarita and Santa Magdalena, but beyond
that he did little to help the cause of Spain. Some
years later exploring parties were sent out from
Mexico, but they found that the wild ice-covered
country was already claimed by the Russians, and
that the Czar had no intention of giving it up.
Other nations, therefore, soon ceased to claim it, and
the Russian hunters and traders were allowed to
enjoy the country in peace.</p>

<p>Alexander Baranof made a great success of the
trade in skins, but the men who took his place were
not equal to him. The company began to lose
money, and the Czar of Russia decided that the
country was too far away from his capital to be properly
looked after. The United States finally made
an offer to buy the great territory from the Czar,
although the government at Washington was not
very anxious to make the purchase. The tract, large
as it was, did not seem to promise much, and it was
almost as far from Washington as it was from St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
Petersburg. The Czar was quite willing to sell,
however, and so the United States bought the country
from him in 1867, paying him $7,200,000 for it.</p>

<p>On a fine October afternoon in 1867 Sitka Bay saw
the Stars and Stripes flying from three United States
war-ships, while the Russian Eagle waved from the
flagstaffs and houses in the small town. On the
shore soldiers of the two nations were drawn up in
front of the old castle, and officers stood waiting at
the foot of the flagpole on the parade ground.
Then a gun was fired from one of the United States
war-ships, and instantly the Russian batteries returned
the salute. A Russian officer lowered his country's
flag from the parade ground pole, and an American
pulled the Stars and Stripes to the peak. Guns
boomed and regimental bands played, and then the
Russian troops saluted and left the fortress, and the
territory became part of the United States.</p>

<p>Up to that time the country had been known as
Russian America, but now a new name had to be
found. Some suggested American Siberia, and
others the Zero Islands; but an American statesman,
Charles Sumner, urged the name of Alaska, a native
word meaning "the Great Land," and this was
the name that was finally adopted.</p>

<p>It took many years to explore the western part of
the United States, and men who were in search of
wealth in mines and forests did not have to go as far
as Alaska to find it. That bleak country was separated
from the United States by a long, stormy sea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
voyage on the Pacific, or a tedious and difficult overland
journey through Canada. Alaska might have
remained for years as little known as while Russia
owned it had it not been for a small party of men who
set out to explore the Yukon and the Klondike Rivers.</p>

<p>On June 16, 1897, a small ship called the <i class="ship">Excelsior</i>
sailed into San Francisco Harbor, and half an hour
after she had landed at her wharf the news was
spreading far and wide that gold had been discovered
in large quantities on the Klondike. Some
of the men had gone out years before; some only a
few months earlier, but they all brought back fortunes.
Not one had left with less than $5,000 in
gold, gathered in nuggets or flakes, in tin cans,
canvas bags, wooden boxes, or wrapped up in paper.
The cry of such sudden wealth was heard by many
adventurers, and the old days of 'Forty-Nine in
California began over again when the wild rush
started north to the Klondike.</p>

<p>On June 17th another ship, the <i class="ship">Portland</i>, arrived
at Seattle, with sixty more miners and $800,000 in
gold. This was the largest find of the precious
mineral that had been made anywhere in the world,
and Seattle followed the example of San Francisco in
going gold-crazy. Immediately hundreds of people
took passage on the outward bound steamers, and
hundreds more were turned away because of lack of
room. Ships set out from all the seaports along the
Pacific coast of the United States, and from the
Canadian ports of Victoria and Vancouver. As in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
the old days of 1849 men gave up their business to
seek the gold fields, but now they had to travel to a
wilder and more desolate country than California
had been.</p>

<p>There were many ways of getting to the Klondike
country. Those who went by ocean steamer had to
transfer to flat-bottomed boats to go up the Yukon
River. This was the easiest route, but the boats
could only be used on the Yukon from June until
September, and the great rush of gold-seekers came
later that autumn. A second route was by the
Chilkoot trail, which had been used for many years
by miners going into the country of the Yukon.
Over this trail horses could be used as far as the foot
of the great Chilkoot Pass, but from there luggage
had to be carried by hand. Another trail, much
like this one, was the White Pass trail, but it led
through a less-known country than the Chilkoot,
and was not so popular. The Canadian government
laid out a trail of its own, which was called
"the Stikeen route," and which ran altogether
through Canadian territory. Besides these there
were innumerable other roads through the mountains,
and along the rivers; but the farther men got
from the better known trails the more danger they
were in of losing their way, or suffering from
hunger and hardships.</p>

<p>Towns blossomed along the coast of Alaska almost
over night, but they were strange looking villages.
The ships that landed at Skagway in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
summer of 1897 found a number of rough frame
houses, with three or four larger than the rest which
hung out hotel signs. The only government officer
lived in a tent over which flew the flag of the United
States. The passengers landed their outfits themselves,
for labor was scarce, and found shelter
wherever they could until they might start on the
trail.</p>

<p>No one seemed to know much about the country
they were going through, but fortunately most of
the men were experienced woodsmen. They loaded
their baggage on their packhorses, and started out,
ready for any sort of country they might have to
cross. Sometimes the trail lay over miry ground,
where a false step to the right or left would send the
horses or men deep into the bog; sometimes it led
up steep and rocky mountainsides, where a man
had to guard his horse's footing as carefully as his
own; and much of the way was in the bed of an old
river, where each step brought a splash of mud, and
left the travelers at the end of the day spattered
from head to foot. The journey was harder on the
horses than on the men. The heavy packs they carried,
and the wretched footing, caused them to drop
along the road from time to time, and then the
travelers had to make the best shift they could with
their luggage. Had the men journeyed alone, or in
small companies, they would have suffered greatly,
but the Chilkoot trail was filled with miners who
were ready to help each other, and to give encouragement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
to any who lagged behind. At Dyea they
came to an old Alaskan settlement, an Indian trading
post, where a number of native tribes lived in
their little wooden cabins. These men were the
Chilkats, the Stikeen Indians, and the Chilkoots,
short, heavy men, with heads and eyes more like
Mongolians than like American Indians. Both men
and women were accustomed to painting their faces
jet black or chocolate brown, in order to protect
their eyes and skin from the glare of the sunlight on
the snow. The traveler could here get Indians to
act as guides, or if he had lost his horses might obtain
dogs and sleds to carry some of his packs.</p>

<p>Each of the little settlements through which the
travelers went boasted of a hotel, usually a frame
building with two or three large rooms. Each day
meals were served to three or four hundred hungry
travelers at rude board tables, and at night the men
would spread their blankets on the floor and lie
down to sleep. But as the trail went farther inland
these little settlements grew fewer, and the men had
to find whatever shelter they could. From Dyea
they pushed on through the Chilkoot Pass, where
the cliffs rose high above them. The winds blew
cold from the north, and the mists kept everything
wet. In the Pass some men turned back, finding
the trip too difficult. Those who went on met with
increasing hardships. They came to a place called
Sheep Camp, where a stream of water and rocks
from the mountain top had swept down upon a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
town of tents and carried them all away. Stories of
similar happenings at other places were passed from
mouth to mouth along the trail. More men turned
back, finding such accidents a good excuse, and only
the most determined stuck to the road.</p>

<p>In time they came to a chain of lakes and rivers.
The travelers stopped to build rude boats and paddles,
and navigated them as best they could. The
rivers were full of rapids, and it was only by a
miracle that the little clumsily-built skiffs went dancing
over the waters safely, and escaped the jutting
rocks on either bank. In the rivers there was good
trout fishing, and in the wild country good hunting,
and Indian boys brought game to the tents at night.
To the trees at each stopping-place papers were
fastened, telling of the marvelous adventures of the
miners who had just gone over the trail. As they
neared Dawson City they found the Yukon River
more and more covered with floating ice, and travel
by boat became harder. After a time the oars, paddles,
gunwales, and all the baggage in the boats was
encrusted with ice, and the boatmen had to make
their way slowly among the floes. Then they came
to a turn in the river, and on the bank saw a great
number of tents and people. "How far is it to Dawson?"
the boatman would call. "This is Dawson.
If you don't look out you'll be carried past," the men
on shore answered. Paddles were thrust into the
ice, and the boat brought to shore. The trip from
Seattle had so far taken ninety-two days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
Food was scarce in Dawson, and men were urged
to leave as soon as they could. Winter was now
setting in, and the miners traveled with dog teams
and sleds to the place where they meant to camp.
Little work could be done in the winter, and the
time was spent in preparing to work the gold fields
in the early spring. All through the cold weather
the men talked of the fortunes waiting for them, and
when the warm weather came they staked out their
claims and set to work. Stories of fabulous finds
spread like wild-fire, and those who were not finding
gold rushed to the places that were proving rich.
That summer many new towns sprang up, and in a
few weeks the Bonanza and Eldorado mines made
their owners rich, and all the tributaries of the Klondike
River were yielding a golden harvest.</p>

<p>When men found land that they thought would
prove rich they made haste to claim it. Sometimes
wild races followed, rivals trying to beat each other
to the government offices at Dawson in order to
claim the land. Frequently after such a wild race
the claim would amount to nothing, while another
man, who had picked out some place that no one
wanted, would find a rich lode and make a fortune
from it. Then there would be great excitement, for
sudden wealth usually went to the miner's head. He
would go down to Dawson, and spend his money
freely, while every one in the town would crowd
around him to share in his good luck. One of the
most successful was a Scotchman, Alexander McDonald.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
At the time of the Klondike strike he was
employed by a company at the town of Forty-Mile.
He had a little money and began to buy separate
pieces of land. He could not afford the rich ground,
but managed to purchase more than forty claims
through the Klondike. At the end of that first season
his fortune was said to be $5,000,000, and might well
have been more, as all his claims had not been fully
worked. He was called "the King of the Klondike,"
and pointed out to newcomers as an example of
what men might do in the gold fields.</p>

<p>That was only the beginning of the story of the
Alaskan gold fields, and each year brought news of
other discoveries. But the one season of 1897 was
enough to prove the great value of Alaska, and to
show that the United States had done well to buy
that great territory from the Czar of Russia. Yet
gold is only a small part of its riches, and even
should the fields of the Klondike yield no more of
the precious mineral, the seals, the fur trade, and the
cities springing up along its coast are worth much
more than the $7,000,000 paid for it. It is still a
land of adventure, one of the few waste places that
beckon men to come and find what wealth lies hidden
within its borders.</p>

<h2><a name="XIV" id="XIV">XIV</a><br />
<br />
<span class="larger">HOW THE "MERRIMAC" WAS SUNK IN SANTIAGO HARBOR</span></h2>

<p>In the small hours of the morning of June 3, 1898,
the <i class="ship">Merrimac</i>, a vessel that had once been a collier
in the United States Navy, slipped away from the
war-ships of the American fleet that lay off the coast
of Cuba, and headed toward the harbor of Santiago.
The moon was almost full, and there was scarcely a
cloud in the sky. To the northwest lay the <i class="ship">Brooklyn</i>,
her great mass almost white in the reflected
light. On the northeast the <i class="ship">Texas</i> loomed dark and
warlike, and farther away lay a ring of other ships,
dim and ghostly in the distance. Ahead was the
coast of Cuba, with an outline of mountains rising in
a half-circle beyond the harbor. Five miles across
the water Morro Castle guarded the entrance to the
harbor, in which lay a fleet of the Spanish Admiral
Cervera.</p>

<p>To steer directly for Morro Castle would be to
keep the <i class="ship">Merrimac</i> full in the moon's path, and to
avoid this she stood to the eastward of the course,
and stole along at a slow rate of speed. The small
crew on board, a commander and seven men, were
stripped to their underclothes and wore life-preservers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
and revolver-belts. Each man had taken his life
in his hand when he volunteered for this night's work.
They wanted to sink the <i class="ship">Merrimac</i> at a narrow point
in the harbor, and bottle up the Spanish fleet beyond
it.</p>

<p>As they neared the great looming fortress of the
Morro it was impossible to keep the ship hidden;
the sentries on the castle must see the dark object
now, and wonder what she intended. The <i class="ship">Merrimac</i>
gave up its oblique course, and steered straight
ahead. The order "Full speed!" went from Lieutenant
Hobson, a naval constructor in command, to
the engineer. Foam dashed over the bows, and the
long shape shot for the harbor entrance, regardless
of what the enemy might think or do. Soon the
Morro stood up high above them, the moon clearly
revealing the great central battery that crowned the
fortress top.</p>

<p>The Spanish guns were only five hundred yards
away, and yet the enemy had given no sign of having
seen the <i class="ship">Merrimac</i>. Then suddenly a light
flashed from near the water's edge on the left side of
the entrance, and a roar followed. The <i class="ship">Merrimac</i>
did not quiver. The shot must have fallen astern.
Again there was a flash, and this time the crew
could hear the splash of water as the projectile
struck back of them. Through their night-glasses
they saw a picket boat with rapid-fire guns lying
close in the shadows of the shore. Her guns had
probably been aimed at the <i class="ship">Merrimac's</i> rudder; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
so far they had missed their aim. With a rapid-fire
gun to reply the <i class="ship">Merrimac</i> might have demolished
the other boat in half a minute, but she had no
such equipment. She would have to pass within a
ship's length of this picket. There was nothing to
do but pay no heed to her aim at the <i class="ship">Merrimac's</i>
rudder, and steer for the high wall off Morro Castle,
where the deep-water channel ran close inshore.
"A touch of port helm!" was the order. "A touch
of port helm, sir," came the answer; and the vessel
stood toward the wall.</p>

<p>There came a crash from the port side. "The
western battery has opened on us, sir!" reported the
man on the bridge to Hobson. "Very well; pay no
attention to it," was the answer. The commander
knew he must take the <i class="ship">Merrimac</i> at least another
ship's length forward, and wondered if the enemy
would give him that much grace. A shot crossed
the bridge, and struck. No one was hurt. They
had almost reached the point where they were
to stop. Another moment or two, and over the
engine telegraph went the order, "Stop!" The
engineer obeyed. The <i class="ship">Merrimac</i> slowed off Morro
rock.</p>

<p>A high rocket shot across the channel entrance.
From each side came the firing of batteries. Hobson
and his men were too busy to heed them. The
<i class="ship">Merrimac</i>, still swinging under her own headway,
brought her bow within thirty feet of the rock before
she righted. Another ship's length, and she would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
be at the point where her commander had planned
to take her; then the stearing-gear stopped working,
and she was left at the mercy of the current.</p>

<p>The ship must be sunk before the current could
carry her out of the course. This was done by exploding
torpedoes on the outside of the vessel.
Hobson gave the order, and the first torpedo went
off, blowing out the collision bulkhead. There was
no reply from the second or third torpedoes. Hobson
crossed the bridge, and shouted, "Fire all torpedoes!"
In the roar of the Spanish batteries his
voice could hardly be heard.</p>

<p>Meantime the guns on the shores back of the
harbor were pouring their shot at the black target in
the moonlight, and the din was terrific. Word came
to Hobson that some of the torpedoes could not be
fired, as their cells had been broken. The order
was given to fire the others, and the fifth exploded
promptly, but the remaining ones had been shattered
by Spanish fire and were useless. The commander
knew that under these circumstances it would take
some time for the <i class="ship">Merrimac</i> to sink.</p>

<p>The important point was to keep the ship in the
center of the harbor; but the stern-anchor had already
been cut away. Hobson watched the bow
move against the shore-line. There was nothing to
do but wait and see where the tide would swing
them.</p>

<p>The crew now gathered on deck. One of them,
Kelly, had been dazed by an exploding shell. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
he had picked himself up he started down the engine-room
hatch, but found the water rising. Then he
remembered the <i class="ship">Merrimac's</i> purpose, and tried to
reach the torpedo of which he had charge. The
torpedo was useless, and he headed back to the
deck, climbing up on all fours. It was a strange
sight to see him stealing up, and Hobson and some
of the others drew their revolvers, thinking for the
moment that he must be an enemy who had boarded
the ship. Fortunately they recognized him almost
immediately.</p>

<p>The tide was bearing them to the center of the
channel when there came a blasting noise and shock.
A mine had exploded beneath them. "Lads, they're
helping us!" cried the commander. But the mine
did not break the deck, and the ship only settled a
little lower. For a moment it seemed as if the coal
might have closed the breach made by the explosion,
but just as the crew feared that they were to be carried
past the point chosen for sinking the current
from the opposite shore caught them, and the <i class="ship">Merrimac</i>
settled crosswise. It was now only a matter
of time before she would sink in the harbor.</p>

<p>The crew could now turn their attention to themselves.
Hobson said to them, "We will remain
here, lads, till the moon sets. When it is dark we
will go down the after-hatch, to the coal, where her
stern will be left out of water. We will remain inside
all day, and to-night at ebb-tide try to make our
way to the squadron. If the enemy comes on board,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
we will remain quiet until he finds us, and will repel
him. If he then turns artillery on the place where
we are, we will swim out to points farther forward."
He started toward the bow to reconnoiter, but was
persuaded not to expose himself to the enemy's fire.
One of the men discovered a break in the bulwarks
that gave a good view, and Hobson stood there.
The moon was bright, though now low, and the
muzzles of the Spanish guns were very near them.
The crew, however, remained safely hidden behind
the rail. From all sides came the firing, and the
Americans, lying full length on the <i class="ship">Merrimac's</i> deck,
felt the continual shock of projectiles striking around
them. Some of the crew suggested that they should
take to the small boat, but the commander knew that
this would be certain destruction, and ordered them
to remain. Presently a shot struck the boiler, and a
rush of steam came up the deck near where they lay.
A canteen was passed from hand to hand. Hobson,
having no pockets, carried some tourniquets around
his left arm, and a roll of antiseptic lint in his left
hand, ready in case any of his crew were wounded.</p>

<p>Looking through the hole in the bulwarks the
commander saw that the <i class="ship">Merrimac</i> was again moving.
Sunk deep though she was, the tide was
carrying her on, and might bear her some distance.
There seemed to be no way in which they could
make her sink where she was. Two more mines exploded,
but missed the ship, and as she floated on it
became evident that they could not block the channel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
completely. But shortly the <i class="ship">Merrimac</i> gave a lurch
forward and settled to the port side. Now the Spanish
<i class="ship">Reina Mercedes</i> was near at hand, and the
<i class="ship">Pluton</i> was coming close inboard, but their guns and
torpedoes did not hasten the sinking of the collier.
She plunged again and settled in the channel.</p>

<p>A rush of water came up the gangway, and the
crew were thrown against the bulwarks, and then
into the sea. The life-preservers helped to keep
them afloat, but when they looked for the life-boat
they found that it had been carried away. A catamaran
was the largest piece of floating wreckage,
and they swam to this. The firing had now stopped.
The wreckage began to drift away, and the crew
were left swimming about the catamaran, apparently
unseen by the enemy. The men were ordered to cling
to this rude craft, their bodies in the water, their heads
hidden by the boards, and to keep quiet, as Spanish
boats were passing close to them. All the crew were
safe, and Hobson expected that in time some Spanish
officers would come out to reconnoiter the channel.
He knew that his men could not swim against the
tide to the harbor entrance, and even had they been
able to do so it would have been too dangerous a
risk, as the banks were now lined with soldiers, and
the water patrolled by small boats. Their hope lay
in surrendering before they were fired upon.</p>

<p>The moon had now nearly set, and the shadow of
the high banks fell across the water. Boats rowed
by Spanish sailors pulled close to the catamaran;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
but acting under orders from their commander the
crew of the <i class="ship">Merrimac</i> kept well out of sight. The
sun rose, and a new day came. Soon the crew could
see the line of distant mountains, and the steep
slopes leading to Morro Castle. A Spanish torpedo-destroyer
was heading up the harbor, and a bugle at
one of the batteries could be heard across the waters.
Still the Americans clung to the catamaran, although
their teeth were chattering, and they had to work
their arms and legs to keep warm.</p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Spanish Boats Pulled Close to Them</span>
</div></div>

<p>Presently one of the men said, "A steam-launch is
heading for us, sir!" The commander looked
about, and saw a large launch, the curtains aft drawn
down, coming from around a point of land straight
toward the catamaran. As it drew near the launch
swerved to the left. When it was about thirty yards
away Hobson hailed it. The boat instantly stopped
and began to back, while some riflemen appeared on
the deck and took position for firing. No shot followed,
however. Hobson called out again, asking
whether there were any officers on the boat, and adding
that if there were he was ready to surrender himself
and his American sailors as prisoners of war.
The curtain at the stern was lowered, a Spanish
officer gave an order, and the rifles dropped. The
American commander swam to the launch, and
climbed on board, being helped up by the Spanish
officer, who turned out later to be no other than Admiral
Cervera himself. Hobson surrendered for
himself and his crew. The launch then drew close<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
to the catamaran, and the sailors clinging to it were
pulled on board. Although the Spaniards knew that
the <i class="ship">Merrimac's</i> men had bottled up their war-ships
in the harbor, they could not help praising their
bravery.</p>

<p>The Spanish launch took them to the <i class="ship">Reina
Mercedes</i>. There the men were given dry clothes
and food. Although all were scratched and bruised
only one was wounded, and his wound, though
painful, was not serious. The American officer
was invited to join the Spaniards at breakfast,
and was treated with as much courtesy as
if he had been an honored guest. Afterward Hobson
wrote a note to Admiral Sampson, who was
in command of the American fleet. The note
read: "Sir: I have the honor to report that the
<i class="ship">Merrimac</i> is sunk in the channel. No loss, only
bruises. We are prisoners of war, being well cared
for." He asked that this should be sent under a flag
of truce. Later in the day the Americans were taken
from the war-ship in a launch, and carried across the
harbor to Morro Castle. This course brought them
within a short distance of where the <i class="ship">Merrimac</i> had
sunk, and as Hobson noted the position he concluded
that the plan had only partly succeeded, and
that the channel was not completely blocked.</p>

<p>Landing at a small wharf the Americans were
marched up a steep hill that led to the Morro from
the rear. The fortress stood out like one of the
mediæval castles of Europe, commanding a wide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
view of sea and shore. The road brought them to
the bridge that crossed the moat. They marched
under the portcullis, and entered a vaulted passage.
The American officer was shown into the guard-room,
while the crew were led on. A few minutes
later Admiral Cervera came into the guard-room,
and held out his hand to Hobson. The admiral said
that he would have liked to send the American's note
under a flag of truce to his fleet, but that this had
been refused by the general in command. He added,
however, that some word should be sent to inform
their friends of the safe escape of the <i class="ship">Merrimac's</i>
men. Hobson was then led to a cell in the tower of
the castle. As the jailer stopped to unlock the door
Hobson had a view of the sea, and made out the line
of the American battle-ships moving in two columns.
He was told to enter the cell, which was a bare and
ill-looking place, but a few minutes later a Spanish
captain arrived with apologies, saying that he
hoped soon to provide the Americans with better
quarters.</p>

<p>A little later furniture was brought to the cell, and
food, cigars, cigarettes, and a bottle of brandy
provided for the American officer. In fact he and
his men fared as well as the Spanish officers and
soldiers themselves. The governor of the fortress
sent a note to ask what he could do to improve
Hobson's comfort. Officers of all ranks called to
shake hands with him, and express their admiration
for his courage. That first night in the castle, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
the sentries had made their rounds, Hobson climbed
up on his cot-bed and looked through a small
window at the top of the cell. The full moon
showed a steep slope from the fortress to the water,
then the wide sweep of the harbor, with a picket-boat
on duty as it had been the night before, and
beyond the boat the great Spanish war-ships, and
still farther off the batteries of Socapa. It was
hard to believe that only twenty-four hours before
the center of that quiet moonlit water had been
ablaze with fire aimed at the small collier Hobson
had commanded. As he studied the situation he
decided that the <i class="ship">Merrimac</i> probably blocked the
channel. The enemy would hesitate a long time
before they would try to take their fleet past the
sunken vessel, and that delay would give Admiral
Sampson time to gather his ships. Even if the
channel were not entirely blocked the Spanish ships
could only leave the harbor in single line and with
the most skilful steering. Therefore he concluded
that his perilous expedition had been successful.</p>

<p>Next morning a Spanish officer brought him
news that a flag of truce had been carried to Admiral
Sampson with word of the crew's escape,
and that the messengers had been given a box
for Hobson, and bags of clothes, some money, and
other articles for him and his crew. The men
now dressed again in the uniform of American
marines, were treated as prisoners of war, and lived
almost as comfortably as their captors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
While Hobson was having his coffee on the
morning of June 6th, he heard the whiz and crash
of an exploding shell, then another, and another,
and knew that a general bombardment of the fortress
had begun. He hastily examined the cell to
see what protection it would offer from bricks and
mortar falling from the walls and roof. At the
first shot the sentry on guard had bolted the door
and left. The American pulled the table and wash-stand
in front of the door, and stood the galvanized
iron box that had been sent him against the end
of the table; this he thought would catch splinters
and stones which would probably be more dangerous
than actual shells. He lay down under the
protection of this cover. He knew that the gunners
of the American fleet were good shots, and figured
that they could easily demolish all that part of
the Morro in which his cell was situated. One
shell after another against the walls of the fortress
made the whole structure tremble, and it seemed as
if part of the walls would be blown away. Fortunately,
however, the firing soon turned in another
direction, and Hobson could come from his shelter,
and, standing on his cot-bed, look through the
window at the battle. Several times he took shelter
again under the table, and several times returned to
watch the cannonade. The shells screamed through
the air; plowed through shrubs and earthworks;
knocked bricks and mortar from the Morro, and set
fire to some of the Spanish ships. But no serious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
damage was done, and the bombardment ended in a
stand-off between the two sides.</p>

<p>The American officer had no desire to pass
through such a cannonade again, and he wrote
to the Spanish governor to ask that his crew and
himself be transferred to safer quarters. Next day
an officer arrived with orders to take all the prisoners
to the city of Santiago. So after a four
days' stay in Morro Castle the little party set out on
an inland march, guarded by some thirty Spanish
soldiers. It was not far to Santiago, and there
the Americans were housed in the regular army
barracks. These quarters were much better than
those in the fortress, and the British Consul secured
many comforts and delicacies for the Americans.</p>

<p>The men of the <i class="ship">Merrimac</i> stayed in Santiago
during the siege of that city. On July 5th arrangements
were made to exchange Hobson and
his men. In the afternoon they were blindfolded
and guided out of the city. Half a mile or more
beyond the entrenchments they were told that they
might remove the handkerchiefs, and found themselves
facing their own troops on a distant ridge.
Soon they were being welcomed by their own men,
who told them of the recent victories won by
fleet and army. Not long afterward they reached
their ships, and were received on board the <i class="ship">New
York</i> by the officers and men who had watched
them set out on their dangerous mission on that
moonlight night of June 3d. They gave a royal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
welcome to the small crew who had brought the
collier into the very heart of the Spanish lines and
sunk her, taking their chances of escape. They
were the heroes of a desperate adventure, from
which every man returned unharmed.</p>
